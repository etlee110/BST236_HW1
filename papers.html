            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07781v1" target="_blank">Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar   streams</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyang Lu, Tongyan Lin, Mukul Sholapurkar, Ana Bonaca</p>
            <p>Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07779v1" target="_blank">Quantum-driven Zero Trust Framework with Dynamic Anomaly Detection in 7G   Technology: A Neural Network Approach</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shakil Ahmed, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Ashfaq Khokhar</p>
            <p>As cyber threats become more complex, modern networks struggle to balance security, scalability, and computational efficiency. While quantum computing offers a promising solution, adoption is limited by scalability constraints, inefficiencies in data encoding, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Neural Network-Enhanced Zero Trust Framework (QNN-ZTF), integrating Zero Trust Architecture, Intrusion Detection Systems, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) for enhanced security. Leveraging superposition, entanglement, and variational optimization, QNN-ZTF enables real-time anomaly detection and adaptive policy enforcement. Key contributions include a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for scalability, dynamic anomaly scoring for improved detection accuracy, and quantum micro-segmentation to contain threats and restrict lateral movement. Evaluation results show improved cyber threat mitigation, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in reducing false positives and response times. This research establishes a scalable, adaptive, and quantum-optimized cybersecurity model, advancing quantum-enhanced security for next-generation networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11889v2" target="_blank">Learning Equivariant Maps with Variational Quantum Circuits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary P. Bradshaw, Ethan N. Evans, Matthew Cook, Margarite L. LaBorde</p>
            <p>Geometric quantum machine learning uses the symmetries inherent in data to design tailored machine learning tasks with reduced search space dimension. The field has been well-studied recently in an effort to avoid barren plateau issues while improving the accuracy of quantum machine learning models. This work explores the related problem of learning an equivariant map given two unitary representations of a finite group, which in turn allows the symmetric embedding of the data to be learned rather than simply required. Moreover, this procedure allows the learning of covariant quantum channels, which are an essential tool in quantum information theory. We demonstrate the feasibility of this task and give examples to illustrate the procedure.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07775v1" target="_blank">Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising   chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward Medina Guerra, Igor Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07773v1" target="_blank">Statistical Reevaluation of the USP Classification Boundary: Smaller   Planets Within 1 Day, Larger Period Ratios Below 2 Days</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armaan V. Goyal, Songhu Wang</p>
            <p>Terrestrial worlds with $P < 1$ day, known as ultra-short period planets (USPs), comprise a physically distinct population whose origins may be attributed to various possible formation channels within multi-planet systems. However, the conventional 1 day boundary adopted for USPs is an arbitrary prescription, and it has yet to be evaluated whether this specific cutoff, or any alternatives, may emerge from the data with minimal assumptions. We accordingly present a statistical evaluation of the USP classification boundary for 376 multi-planet systems across Kepler, K2, and TESS. We find that USPs are smaller in size ($p = 0.004$) and exhibit larger period ratios with their immediate neighbors ($\mathcal{P} = P_{2}/P_{1}$; $p < 10^{-4}$) when compared to non-USP short-period ($1 < P/\text{days} < 5$) worlds, and that these discrepancies rapidly transition towards statistical insignificance ($p > 0.05$) at respective orbital periods of $P_{R} = 0.97^{+0.25}_{-0.19}$ days and $P_{\mathcal{P}} = 2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ days (see Figure 3). We verify that these results are not driven by imprecise planetary parameters, giant companions, low-mass host stars, or detection biases. Our findings provide qualitative support for pathways in which proto-USPs are detached from companions and delivered to $P \lesssim 2$ days via eccentric migration, while a subset of these objects near $P \sim 1$ day experience subsequent orbital decay and refractory mass loss to become USPs. These results lend evidence towards an astrophysical basis for the 1 day USP cutoff and encourage consideration of an additional 2 day boundary within future investigations of USP architectures and evolutionary dynamics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07770v1" target="_blank">Quantum learning advantage on a scalable photonic platform</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng-Hao Liu, Romain Brunel, Emil E. B. Ã˜stergaard, Oscar Cordero, Senrui Chen, Yat Wong, Jens A. H. Nielsen, Axel B. Bregnsbo, Sisi Zhou, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Changhun Oh, Liang Jiang, John Preskill, Jonas S. Neergaard-Nielsen, Ulrik L. Andersen</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in quantum technologies have opened new horizons for exploring the physical world in ways once deemed impossible. Central to these breakthroughs is the concept of quantum advantage, where quantum systems outperform their classical counterparts in solving specific tasks. While much attention has been devoted to computational speedups, quantum advantage in learning physical systems remains a largely untapped frontier. Here, we present a photonic implementation of a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning the probability distribution of a multimode bosonic displacement process. By harnessing the unique properties of continuous-variable quantum entanglement, we obtain a massive advantage in sample complexity with respect to conventional methods without entangled resources. With approximately 5 dB of two-mode squeezing -- corresponding to imperfect Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) entanglement -- we learn a 100-mode bosonic displacement process using 11.8 orders of magnitude fewer samples than a conventional scheme. Our results demonstrate that even with non-ideal, noisy entanglement, a significant quantum advantage can be realized in continuous-variable quantum systems. This marks an important step towards practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols with implications for quantum metrology, certification, and machine learning.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19163v2" target="_blank">Exact Floquet solutions in a Parity-Time-Symmetric Rabi Model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Baradaran, D. Braak, L. M. Nieto, S. Zarrinkamar</p>
            <p>It is shown that a semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11135v4" target="_blank">Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser   field</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Elkind, Noam Popper, Itamar Cohen, Nitzan Alaluf, Assaf Levanon, Ishay Pomerantz</p>
            <p>We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. Using only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6 MeV, exceeding those reported with any other experimental method by a factor of 3. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher accelerating electric field gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this ion acceleration technique opens up the possibility of laser ion acceleration in multiple stages, allowing manipulation of the accelerated ion spectrum by optical means.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07757v1" target="_blank">SIGGRAPH: G: Improved Projective Dynamics Global Using Snapshots-based   Reduced Bases</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaimaa Monem, Peter Benner, Christian Lessig</p>
            <p>We propose a snapshots-based method to compute reduction subspaces for physics-based simulations. Our method is applicable to any mesh with some artistic prior knowledge of the solution and only requires a record of existing solutions during, for instance, the range-of-motion test that is required before approving a mesh character for an application. Our subspaces span a wider range of motion, especially large deformations, and rotations by default. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we achieve improved numerical stability, computational efficiency, and more realistic simulations with a smaller sub-space.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22328v2" target="_blank">Wavelength modulation laser spectroscopy of N$_2$O at 17 $Î¼$m</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Wang, J. Rodewald, O. Lopez, M. Manceau, B. DarquiÃ©, B. E. Sauer, M. R. Tarbutt</p>
            <p>Using a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser and wavelength modulation absorption spectroscopy, we measure the frequencies of ro-vibrational transitions of N$_2$O in the 17 $\mu$m region with uncertainties below 5 MHz. These lines, corresponding to the bending mode of the molecule, can be used for calibration of spectrometers in this spectral region. We present a model for the lineshapes of absorption features in wavelength modulation spectroscopy that takes into account Doppler broadening, collisional broadening, saturation of the absorption, and lineshape distortion due to frequency and intensity modulation. Combining our data with previous measurements, we provide a set of spectroscopic parameters for several vibrational states of N$_2$O. The lines measured here fall in the same spectral region as a mid-infrared frequency reference that we are currently developing using trapped, ultracold molecules. With such a frequency reference, the spectroscopic methods demonstrated here have the potential to improve frequency calibration in this part of the spectrum.</p>
