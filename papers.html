            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05302v1" target="_blank">Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue   engineering devices through protein sulfonation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew K Burgess, Ryan T Murray, Veronica M Lucian, Zekun Liu, Robin O Cleveland, Callum J Beeston, Malavika Nair</p>
            <p>Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05296v1" target="_blank">Let it Snow! Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather   Effects</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Fiebelman, Hadar Averbuch-Elor, Sagie Benaim</p>
            <p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and physical realism.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05293v1" target="_blank">A BLE and UWB Beacon-Assist Framework for Multiuser Augmented Reality   Synchronization Across Multiple Devices in Shared Environments</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitree Hirunteeyakul</p>
            <p>The challenge to synchronize augmented reality (AR) across sessions/devices has been solved by relying solely on vision-feature mapping, which is suboptimal in scaling workable space and flaws under visual changes in surroundings. This study implemented AR synchronization solutions utilizing location beacon technology, namely Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB), to discourse scalability issues and inconsistencies in the existing AR system. The framework is bifurcated into two approaches: BLE-assist and UWB-assist AR synchronization. The BLE-assist method utilizes iBeacon technology for room context recognition, integrating with Apple's ARKit ARWorldMap and Google's ARCore Cloud Anchors. The UWB-assist solution employs precise beacon ranging capabilities fusion with the device's azimuth to establish fixed spatial reference in AR across sessions/devices. Comparative evaluations show that the UWB-assist approach outperforms the BLE-assist approach in reliability across environmental variations, as it always successfully resolves virtual anchors with a near-constant latency average at 25 seconds, regardless of the physical setting changes. Conversely, the BLE-assist implementation tends to be more accurate in resolving virtual anchors with a mean of 0.02 metres in position error and within 0.03 radian in orientation error. In the UWB-assist approach, computed fixed spatial references have an average disparity of 0.04 metres and 0.11 radians in pose. The UWB-assist approach is ideal for scenarios requiring consistently successful localization with acceptable accuracy. In contrast, the BLE-assist approach is more suitable when demanding finer precision in virtual anchor poses with the performance tradeoffs when the surroundings are altered, such as for destinated short-lived AR sessions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05292v1" target="_blank">Itzykson-Zuber correlators from character expansion</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexei Morozov, Hasib Sifat</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials with the old formulas for pair correlators with the IZ measure. The non-symmetrical structure of the correlators led us to derive an ansatz for the decomposition of the differentiated Schur polynomials to calculate all the pair correlators. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05262v5" target="_blank">New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an   alternative to dark energy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Ky Nguyen</p>
            <p>In A&A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05289v2" target="_blank">Direct Measurement of the Singlet Lifetime and Photoexcitation Behavior   of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard A. Escalante, Andrew J. Beling, Niko Reed, Justin Welter, John Blanchard, Daniel G. Ang, Cecilia Campos, Edwin Coronel, Klaus Krambrock, Alexandre S. Leal, Paras N. Prasad, Ronald L. Walsworth</p>
            <p>Optically active electronic spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a promising platform for quantum sensing, as they can enable shorter standoff distances compared to defects in diamond, leading to sensitivity advantages. Perhaps the most studied defect in a vdW material is the negatively charged boron vacancy center ($V^{-}_{B}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, many of the $V^{-}_{B}$ electronic and spin transition rates and branching ratios are not fully known. Here, we use time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements with a nanosecond rise-time 515 nm laser to determine directly the singlet state lifetime of a $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in neutron-irradiated, sub-micron-size flakes of hBN. We perform this measurement on 16 different hBN flakes at room temperature and obtain an average lifetime of 15(3) ns. Additionally, we probe the PL dynamics of thermal and optically polarized electronic spin distributions of the $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in a single sub-micron hBN flake, and fit our results to a 9-level model to extract the electronic transition rates. Lastly, we present PL measurements that potentially indicate optically-induced conversion of $V^{-}_{B}$ to another electronic state, or possibly the neutral charge state (V$^{0}_{B}$), in neutron-irradiated hBN flakes of size $>$ 1 $\mu$m.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16593v2" target="_blank">Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary T. Hilliard, Mohammad Farazmand</p>
            <p>Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05286v1" target="_blank">UK APAP R-matrix electron-impact excitation cross-sections for modelling   laboratory and astrophysical plasma</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Del Zanna, G. Liang, J. Mao, N. R. Badnell</p>
            <p>Systematic R-matrix calculations of electron-impact excitation for ions of astrophysical interest have been performed since 2007 for many iso-electronic sequences as part of the UK Atomic Process for Astrophysical Plasma (APAP) network. Rate coefficients for Maxwellian electron distributions have been provided and used extensively in the literature and many databases for astrophysics. Here, we provide averaged collision strengths to be used to model plasma where electrons are non-Maxwellian, which often occur in laboratory and astrophysical plasma. We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths which include important corrections to the published values. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in Mao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-, Ne-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05282v1" target="_blank">Estimation of Heat Transfer Coefficient in Heat Exchangers from   closed-loop data using Neural Networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramachandran Anantharaman, Carlos Gonzalez Rojas, Luna Artemis van Leeuwen, Leyla Özkan</p>
            <p>Heat exchangers (HEXs) play a central role in process industries for thermal energy transfer. Fouling, the gradual accumulation of solids on heat transfer surfaces, causes a time-varying decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient (U(t)), significantly impacting the efficiency of heat transfer. Good estimation and modeling of fouling (the heat transfer coefficient) will lead to better fouling mitigation strategies. This study investigates the identifiability of the time-varying $U(t)$ in HEXs from closed-loop operational data, without external excitation of reference signals or knowledge of the controller parameters. We establish that while the complete system model cannot be identified under these given constraints, the time-varying heat transfer coefficient $U(t)$ remains identifiable. Further, we propose a neural network based architecture, called (Per-PINN), for estimation and modeling the heat transfer coefficient from the closed-loop system data. This Per-PINN model is shown to perform better than the existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) based models for inverse parameter learning as it inherently fixes the underlying physical equations and learns only the time-varying parameter U(t).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05281v1" target="_blank">Decoding the variability in the star-formation histories of z ~ 0.8   galaxies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jenny T. Wan, Sandro Tacchella, Francesco D'Eugenio, Benjamin D. Johnson, Arjen van der Wel</p>
            <p>The scatter of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) holds a wealth of information about how galaxies evolve. The timescales encoded in this scatter can provide valuable insight into the relative importance of the physical processes regulating star formation. In this paper, we present a detailed observational analysis of the timescales imprinted in galaxy star-formation history (SFH) fluctuations by using the stochastic SFH model to fit 1928 massive, z ~ 0.8 galaxies in the LEGA-C survey. We find that the total intrinsic scatter of the SFMS is ~0.3 dex in galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. This scatter decreases as the timescale over which SFRs are averaged increases, declining to a non-negligible ~0.15 - 0.25 dex at 2 Gyr, underscoring the importance of long-timescale SFH diversity to the SFMS scatter. Furthermore, galaxies currently above (below) the SFMS tend to have been above (below) the SFMS for at least ~1 Gyr, providing evidence that individual galaxies may follow different median tracks through SFR$-\mathrm{M}_*$ space. On shorter timescales (~30 - 100 Myr), galaxies' SFRs also vary on the order of ~0.1 - 0.2 dex. Our work supports the idea that the SFMS emerges from a population average of the pathways that individual galaxies trace through the SFR$-\mathrm{M}_*$ plane. The scatter reflects the long-term heterogeneity of these paths likely set by the evolutionary timescales of halo growth and cooling, accentuated by short-term variations reflecting the dynamical timescale of the galaxy and its interstellar medium. Our results emphasize the dynamic nature of the SFMS and the importance of understanding the diverse processes governing star formation.</p>
