            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03148v1" target="_blank">Self-Supervised Spatial Correspondence Across Modalities</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Shrivastava, Andrew Owens</p>
            <p>We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03146v1" target="_blank">Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless   topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reja H. Wilke, Henning Schl√∂mer, Simon M. Linsel, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03138v1" target="_blank">Change of bifurcation type in 2D free boundary model of a moving cell   with nonlinear diffusion</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonid Berlyand, Oleksii Krupchytskyi, Tim Laux</p>
            <p>We introduce a 2D free boundary problem with nonlinear diffusion that models a living cell moving on a substrate. We prove that this nonlinearity results in a qualitative of solution behavior compared to the linear diffusion case (Rybalko et al. TAMS 2023), namely the switch between direct and inverse pitchfork bifurcation.   Our objectives are twofold:   (i) develop a rigorous framework to prove existence of bifurcation and determining its type (subcritical vs. superctitical) and (ii) the derivation of explicit analytical formulas that control the change of bifurcation type in terms of physical parameters and explain the underlying biophysical mechanisms.   While the standard way of applying the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem via the solution operator seems difficult in our quasilinear PDE system, we apply the theorem directly, by developing a multidimensional, vectorial framework. To determine the bifurcation type, we extract the curvature of the bifurcating curve from the expansion of the solutions around the steady state. The formula for the curvature is obtained via a solvability condition where instead of the Fredholm alternative, we propose a test function trick, suited for free boundary problems.   Our rigorous analytical results are in agreement with numerical observations from the physical literature in 1D (Drozdowski et al. Comm. Phys. 2023) and provide the first extension of this phenomenon to a 2D free boundary model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03137v1" target="_blank">The perfect entangler spectrum as a tool to analyze crosstalk</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias G. Krauss, Christiane P. Koch</p>
            <p>Crosstalk is a key obstacle to scaling up quantum computers. It may arise from persistent qubit-qubit couplings or dynamically during gate operation, with the latter being particularly difficult to detect. Here, we introduce the perfect entangler spectrum as a means to identify dynamic crosstalk leading to undesired entanglement. It leverages the geometric classification of two-qubit gates in terms of perfect entanglers. We exemplify application of the spectroscopy for fixed-frequency transmons and parametrically driven gates: When scanning the frequency of a spectator qubit, peaks in the perfect entangler spectrum signal dynamic crosstalk, and analysis of the peaks reveals the mechanisms causing the crosstalk. We discuss the experimental implementation of the crosstalk spectroscopy which requires two two-qubit gate tomographies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03134v1" target="_blank">Simulate Any Radar: Attribute-Controllable Radar Simulation via Waveform   Parameter Embedding</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiqing Xiao, Hao Huang, Chonghao Zhong, Yujie Lin, Nan Wang, Xiaoxue Chen, Zhaoxi Chen, Saining Zhang, Shuocheng Yang, Pierre Merriaux, Lei Lei, Hao Zhao</p>
            <p>We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03129v1" target="_blank">Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic   and Carrollian Perspectives</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Chen, Song He, Jue Hou</p>
            <p>Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01312v2" target="_blank">Dynamical dark energy and gravitational coupling from moving geometries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Thibaut</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. The actions feature a generalization of the Nieh-Yan topological term for a varying coupling constant. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge $+$ matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. The action becomes asymptotically topological when the gauge action contribution to dark energy vanishes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08098v2" target="_blank">Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial   majorization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. E. Shirokov</p>
            <p>We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.   The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=0$ coincide with the (unconditional) optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686]. State-dependent improvements of these semicontinuity bounds are proposed and analysed numerically.   The notion of $\varepsilon$-sufficient majorization dimension of the set of states with bounded energy is introduced and analysed.   Classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy are also considered.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03127v1" target="_blank">Scalable Distributed Memory Implementation of the Quasi-Adiabatic   Propagator Path Integral</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Ovcharenko, Benjamin P. Fingerhut</p>
            <p>The accurate simulation of dissipative quantum dynamics subject to a non-Markovian environment poses persistent numerical challenges, in particular for structured environments where sharp mode resonances induce long-time system bath correlations. We present a scalable distributed memory implementation of the Mask Assisted Coarse Graining of Influence Coefficients (MACGIC) - Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (-QUAPI) method that exploits the memory resources of multiple compute nodes and mitigates the memory bottleneck of the method via a new pre-merging algorithm while preserving numerical accuracy. The distributed memory implementation spreads the paths over the computing nodes by means of the MPI protocoll and efficient high level path management is achieved via an implementation based on hash maps. The efficiency of the new implementation is demonstrated in large-scale dissipative quantum dynamics simulations that account for the coupling to a structured non-Markovian environment containing a sharp resonance, a setup for which convergence properties are investigated in depth. Broad applicability and the non-perturbative nature of the simulation method is illustrated via the tuning of the mode resonance frequency of the structured environment with respect to the system frequency. The simulations reveal a splitting of resonances due to strong system-environment interaction and the emergence of sidebands due to multi-excitations of the bosonic mode that are not accounted for in perturbative approaches. The simulations demonstrate the versatility of the new MACGIC-QUAPI method in the presence of strong non-Markovian system bath correlations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03124v1" target="_blank">Simulating dynamics of correlated matter with neural quantum states</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Schmitt, Markus Heyl</p>
            <p>While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.</p>
