            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21319v1" target="_blank">Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juven Wang</p>
            <p>Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21317v1" target="_blank">Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network   interatomic potentials</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, Zakariya El-Machachi, Krystian A. Gierczak, John L. A. Gardner, Volker L. Deringer</p>
            <p>With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13887v2" target="_blank">Signatures of Light New Particles in $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick D. Bolton, Svjetlana Fajfer, Jernej F. Kamenik, Mart√≠n Novoa-Brunet</p>
            <p>The recent Belle II observation of $B \to K E_{\rm miss}$ challenges theoretical interpretations in terms of Standard Model neutrino final states. Instead, we consider new physics scenarios where up to two new light-invisible particles of spin 0 up to 3/2 are present in the final state. We identify viable scenarios by reconstructing the (binned) likelihoods of the relevant $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ and also $B_s \to E_{\rm miss}$ experimental analyses and present preferred regions of couplings and masses. In particular, we find that the current data prefers two-body decay kinematics involving the emission of a single massive scalar or a vector particle, or alternatively, three-body decays involving pairs of massive scalars or spin 1/2 fermions. When applicable, we compare our findings with existing literature and briefly discuss some model-building implications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21312v1" target="_blank">Flexible Tuning of Asymmetric Near-field Radiative Thermal Transistor by   Utilizing Distinct Phase Change Materials</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hexiang Zhang, Xuguang Zhang, Fangqi Chen, Mauro Antezza, Yi Zheng</p>
            <p>Phase change materials (PCMs) play a pivotal role in the development of advanced thermal devices due to their reversible phase transitions, which drastically modify their thermal and optical properties. In this study, we present an effective dynamic thermal transistor with an asymmetric design that employs distinct PCMs, vanadium dioxide (VO2) and germanium antimony telluride (GST), on either side of the gate terminal, which is the center of the control unit of the near-field thermal transistor. This asymmetry introduces unique thermal modulation capabilities, taking control of thermal radiation in the near-field regime. VO2 transitions from an insulating to a metallic state, while GST undergoes a reversible switch between amorphous (aGST) and crystalline (cGST) phases, each inducing substantial changes in thermal transport properties. By strategically combining these materials, the transistor exhibits enhanced functionality, dynamically switching between states of absorbing and releasing heat by tuning the temperature of gate. This gate terminal not only enables active and efficient thermal management but also provides effective opportunities for manipulating heat flow in radiative thermal circuits. Our findings highlight the potential of such asymmetrically structured thermal transistors in advancing applications across microelectronics, high-speed data processing, and sustainable energy systems, where precise and responsive thermal control is critical for performance and efficiency.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19775v2" target="_blank">Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional   Keller-Segel system</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Y. Hou, Van Tien Nguyen, Peicong Song</p>
            <p>We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution of the two-dimensional system. Additionally, mass concentration occurs along a one-dimensional ring in the plane. In the analysis, we rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21302v1" target="_blank">Impact of Quantum Well Thickness on Efficiency Loss in InGaN/GaN LEDs:   Challenges for Thin-Well Designs</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuefeng Li, Nick Pant, Sheikh Ifatur Rahman, Rob Armitage, Siddharth Rajan, Emmanouil Kioupakis, Daniel Feezell</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of quantum well (QW) thickness on efficiency loss in c-plane InGaN/GaN LEDs using a small-signal electroluminescence (SSEL) technique. Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently examined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs. current density relationship, phase space filling (PSF), quantum confined stark effect (QCSE), and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for quantum wells having constant In composition. Despite better control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance of enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger-Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance of enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with quantum well thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21299v1" target="_blank">Does the 220 PeV Event at KM3NeT Point to New Physics?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vedran Brdar, Dibya S. Chattopadhyay</p>
            <p>The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the observation of KM3-230213A, a neutrino event with an energy exceeding 100 PeV, more than an order of magnitude higher than the most energetic neutrino in IceCube's catalog. Given its longer data-taking period and larger effective area relative to KM3NeT, IceCube should have observed events around that energy. This tension has recently been quantified to lie between $2\sigma$ and $3.5\sigma$, depending on the neutrino source. A $\mathscr{O}(100)$ PeV neutrino detected at KM3NeT has traversed approximately $147$ km of rock and sea en route to the detector, whereas neutrinos arriving from the same location in the sky would have only traveled through about $14$ km of ice before reaching IceCube. We use this difference in propagation distance to address the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which the source emits sterile neutrinos that partially convert to active neutrinos through oscillations. We scrutinize two such realizations, one where a new physics matter potential induces a resonance in sterile-to-active transitions and another one where off-diagonal neutrino non-standard interactions are employed. In both cases, sterile-to-active neutrino oscillations become relevant at length scales of $\sim100$ km, resulting in increased active neutrino flux near the KM3NeT detector, alleviating the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Overall, we propose the exciting possibility that neutrino telescopes may have started detecting new physics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15714v2" target="_blank">On Asymptotic Dark Energy in String Theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sera Cremonini, Eduardo Gonzalo, Muthusamy Rajaguru, Yuezhang Tang, Timm Wrase</p>
            <p>We examine bounds on accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of the moduli space in string theory compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. While there are conjectures that forbid or constrain accelerated expansion in such asymptotic regions, potential counter examples have been discussed recently in the literature. We check whether such counter examples can arise in explicit string theory constructions, focusing in particular on non-geometric compactifications of type IIB string theory that have no K\"ahler moduli. We find no violation of the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture and thus provide support for the absence of accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of a barely explored corner of the string landscape. Moreover, working in a simplified setting, we point out a new mechanism for potentially connecting the Sharpened Distance Conjecture and the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture. If this argument could be generalized, it would mean that the Sharpened Distance Conjecture is implied by the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture, and that their exponential factors are naturally related by a factor of 2.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21298v1" target="_blank">The quantum Newton's bucket: Active and passive rotations in quantum   theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Augusto Facundes da Silva, Kayman Jhosef Goncalves, Giorgio Torrieri</p>
            <p>Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21295v1" target="_blank">Quantum arrival times in free fall</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathieu Beau, Timothey Szczepanski, Rafael Martellini, Lionel Martellini</p>
            <p>The probability distribution of a time measurement $T_x$ at position $x$ can be inferred from the probability distribution of a position measurement $X_t$ at time $t$ as given by the Born rule [Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems and application to quantum backflow, Phys. Rev. A 110, 052217 (2024)]. In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival in the long time-of-flight regime for dropped quantum particles [M. Beau and L. Martellini, Quantum delay in the time of arrival of free-falling atoms, Phys. Rev. A 109, 012216 (2024).]. The present paper extends these results in two important directions. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} . $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in the measured arrival time. Secondly, we examine the case of a free-falling particle starting from a non-Gaussian initial superposed state, for which we predict the presence of gravitationally induced interferences and oscillations in the mean time-of-arrival as a function of the detector's position that can be interpreted as the signature of a Zitterbewegung-like effect.</p>
