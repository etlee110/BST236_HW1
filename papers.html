            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22658v1" target="_blank">A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan P. Marsh, David Atri Schuller, Yunpeng Ji, Henry S. Hunt, Giulia Z. Socolof, Deven P. Bowman, Jonathan Keeling, Benjamin L. Lev</p>
            <p>We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22638v1" target="_blank">SimProcess: High Fidelity Simulation of Noisy ICS Physical Processes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Donadel, Gabriele Crestanello, Giulio Morandini, Daniele Antonioli, Mauro Conti, Massimo Merro</p>
            <p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations, causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example, undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake. ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.   In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22634v1" target="_blank">LabUtopia: High-Fidelity Simulation and Hierarchical Benchmark for   Scientific Embodied Agents</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Li, Zixuan Hu, Wenxi Qu, Jinouwen Zhang, Zhenfei Yin, Sha Zhang, Xuantuo Huang, Hanqing Wang, Tai Wang, Jiangmiao Pang, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai, Wangmeng Zuo, Ling-Yu Duan, Dongzhan Zhou, Shixiang Tang</p>
            <p>Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning, making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene, a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii) LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30 distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments. We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22629v1" target="_blank">Disambiguating Pauli noise in quantum computers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward H. Chen, Senrui Chen, Laurin E. Fischer, Andrew Eddins, Luke C. G. Govia, Brad Mitchell, Andre He, Youngseok Kim, Liang Jiang, Alireza Seif</p>
            <p>To successfully perform quantum computations, it is often necessary to first accurately characterize the noise in the underlying hardware. However, it is well known that fundamental limitations prevent the unique identification of the noise. This raises the question of whether these limitations impact the ability to predict noisy dynamics and mitigate errors. Here, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that when learnable parameters are self-consistently characterized, the unlearnable (gauge) degrees of freedom do not impact predictions of noisy dynamics or error mitigation. We use the recently introduced framework of gate set Pauli noise learning to efficiently and self-consistently characterize and mitigate noise of a complete gate set, including state preparation, measurements, single-qubit gates and multi-qubit entangling Clifford gates. We validate our approach through experiments with up to 92 qubits and show that while the gauge choice does not affect error-mitigated observable values, optimizing it reduces sampling overhead. Our findings address an outstanding issue involving the ambiguities in characterizing and mitigating quantum noise.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22624v1" target="_blank">Spectroscopic Observations of Supra-Arcade Downflows</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan J. French, Maria D. Kazachenko, Teodora Mihailescu, Katharine K. Reeves</p>
            <p>Despite their somewhat-frequent appearance in EUV imaging of off-limb flares, the origins of Supra-Arcade Downflows (SADs) remain a mystery. Appearing as dark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves are yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of their origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last published SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER) era in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an M-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV 192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the low-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare fan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII 263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature, revealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We compare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities measured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs, finding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly related to the presence of a high altitude termination shock. Finally, we detect 'stealth' SADs, which produce SAD-like Doppler signals, yet with no change in intensity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22623v1" target="_blank">A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium   steady-states</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seokjin Moon, David T. Limmer</p>
            <p>We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady-states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion-pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13699v5" target="_blank">On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy   conservation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo De Carlo</p>
            <p>In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16911v2" target="_blank">Status and prospects of the $χ_{c1}(3872)$ at BESIII</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjian Zhou, Xin Liu, Yueming Zhang, Chunhua Li</p>
            <p>The $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ serves as a pivotal role for understanding hadronic structures, remaining one of the most extensively studied exotic particles despite the experimental discovery of numerous unconventional hadronic states. Sustained experimental and theoretical investigations into the particle over the past two decades have propelled its study into a high-precision regime, marked by refined measurements of its decay dynamics and line shape, thereby offering critical insights to resolve longstanding debates between molecular, tetraquark, hybrid, and charmonium interpretations of this particle. The BESIII experiment has made seminal contributions to the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, leveraging its unique capabilities in high-statistics data acquisition and low-background condition. This article gives a concise review and prospects of the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ from the BESIII experiment.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12514v2" target="_blank">The Sky as a Killing Horizon</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, Andre G. S. Landulfo</p>
            <p>Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22614v1" target="_blank">Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Zhi Zhou, Zhi-Chao Li, Di Wu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0<f_{\mathrm{NL}}<1.2$.</p>
