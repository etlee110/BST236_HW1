            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15220v3" target="_blank">Reduced Hubble Tension in Dark Radiation Models after DESI 2024</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itamar J. Allali, Alessio Notari, Fabrizio Rompineve</p>
            <p>We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be less than $3\sigma$ and as low as $2\sigma$, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$. Upcoming data releases by DESI and other CMB and LSS surveys will decisively confirm or disfavour this conclusion.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08677v2" target="_blank">OmniPaint: Mastering Object-Oriented Editing via Disentangled   Insertion-Removal Inpainting</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongsheng Yu, Ziyun Zeng, Haitian Zheng, Jiebo Luo</p>
            <p>Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized object-oriented image editing, yet their deployment in realistic object removal and insertion remains hampered by challenges such as the intricate interplay of physical effects and insufficient paired training data. In this work, we introduce OmniPaint, a unified framework that re-conceptualizes object removal and insertion as interdependent processes rather than isolated tasks. Leveraging a pre-trained diffusion prior along with a progressive training pipeline comprising initial paired sample optimization and subsequent large-scale unpaired refinement via CycleFlow, OmniPaint achieves precise foreground elimination and seamless object insertion while faithfully preserving scene geometry and intrinsic properties. Furthermore, our novel CFD metric offers a robust, reference-free evaluation of context consistency and object hallucination, establishing a new benchmark for high-fidelity image editing.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08674v1" target="_blank">Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning   Force Fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08671v1" target="_blank">Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of   spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amirhossein Samandar, Javier Carrón Duque, Craig J. Copi, Mikel Martin Barandiaran, Deyan P. Mihaylov, Glenn D. Starkman, Yashar Akrami, Stefano Anselmi, Fernando Cornet-Gomez, Johannes R. Eskilt, Andrew H. Jaffe, Arthur Kosowsky, Anna Negro, Joline Noltmann, Thiago S. Pereira, Andrius Tamosiunas</p>
            <p>We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08663v1" target="_blank">Generating Robot Constitutions & Benchmarks for Semantic Safety</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Sermanet, Anirudha Majumdar, Alex Irpan, Dmitry Kalashnikov, Vikas Sindhwani</p>
            <p>Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08661v1" target="_blank">Task-Oriented Co-Design of Communication, Computing, and Control for   Edge-Enabled Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufeng Diao, Yichi Zhang, Daniele De Martini, Philip Guodong Zhao, Emma Liying Li</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a task-oriented co-design framework that integrates communication, computing, and control to address the key challenges of bandwidth limitations, noise interference, and latency in mission-critical industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08659v1" target="_blank">On new physics off the Z peak in $H \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- γ$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aliaksei Kachanovich, Jean Kimus, Steven Lowette, Michel H. G. Tytgat</p>
            <p>Motivated by a small but intriguing excess observed in the decay mode $ H\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ reported by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we explore the possibility that new physics contributes directly to the effective $ H \ell \overline{\ell} \gamma $ coupling rather than modifying the $ Z $ peak. Concretely, we consider a dimension-8 operator that could arise from new particles via box diagrams. Such non-resonant contribution may provide an alternative origin for current or future excesses. We examine how experimental cuts may distinguish between possible modifications of the $ Z $ peak and non-resonant contributions. The currently measured excess requires that the new physics scale is relatively low $( \Lambda_R \sim v $). However, we show that it may remain within current experimental bounds. In particular, we illustrate this using a simplified model, motivated by the dark matter problem, and discuss its other experimental constraints.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08657v1" target="_blank">Massive fields and Wilson spools in JT gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jackson R. Fliss</p>
            <p>We give a prescription for minimally coupling massive matter to JT gravity with either sign of cosmological constant directly in its formulation as a topological BF theory. This coupling takes the form of a `Wilson spool,' originally introduced in the context of three-dimensional gravity. The Wilson spool expresses the exact one-loop partition function as the integral over a Wilson loop operator. We construct the spool by considering the partition function of a massive scalar field on Euclidean dS$_2$ and on Euclidean AdS$_2$. We discuss its extension to other geometries (including the `trumpet' and conical defect geometries) and its relation to the three-dimensional spool through dimensional reduction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13001v2" target="_blank">Many-Body Basis Set Amelioration Method for Incremental Full   Configuration Interaction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey P Hatch, Alan E Rask, Duy-Khoi Dang, Paul M Zimmerman</p>
            <p>Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) is polynomial-cost approach to the FCI limit of electronic structure. This article introduces the many-body basis set amelioration (MBBSA) method, which is designed to allow iFCI to be applicable to larger atomic orbital basis sets. MBBSA uses a series of inexpensive iFCI calculations to approximate the correlation energy that would be found using a more expensive, highly accurate iFCI calculation. When compared to standard iFCI computations on smaller molecules in triple-zeta and larger basis sets, MBBSA provides approximations to total and relative energies within chemical accuracy. MBBSA yields cost savings of between 60 and 92% when compared to standard iFCI calculations, with larger systems having increased savings. Tests of MBBSA on two reactions that involve highly correlated systems, the automerization of cyclobutadiene and a Criegee intermediate reaction, show that MBBSA has practical utility for studying realistic chemistries.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08651v1" target="_blank">Hydrogenlike molecules composed of $D_1D_1$, $D_1D^*_2$ and $D^*_2D^*_2$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hu-Hua He, Mao-Jun Yan, Chun-Sheng An, Cheng-Rong Deng</p>
            <p>We systematically explore the S-wave $D_1D_1$, $D_1D^*_2$ and $D^*_2D^*_2$ states with various isospin-spin-orbit ($ISL$) configurations in the quark model. We propose nine stable dimeson states with the $ISL$ configurations, $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, $102$, $110$, $112$, $120$, and $122$, against dissociation into their constituent mesons. Those bound states are hydrogenlike molecular states, where the two subclusters are moderately overlapped and the QCD covalent bond is formed due to the delocalization of light quarks. The QCD covalent bond serves as the primary binding mechanism in the bound states with $I=1$. However, the exchange of $\pi$ and $\sigma$-meson plays a pivotal role in the bound states with $I=0$. The coupled-channel effect is essential in the formation of the bound states with $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, and $102$.</p>
