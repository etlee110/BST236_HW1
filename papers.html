            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13179v1" target="_blank">ViTa-Zero: Zero-shot Visuotactile Object 6D Pose Estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Li, James Akl, Srinath Sridhar, Tye Brady, Taskin Padir</p>
            <p>Object 6D pose estimation is a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for manipulation tasks. While prior research combining visual and tactile (visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle with generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In this paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation framework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone and performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on physical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations. Specifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system, where tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates repulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world robot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual backbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and bimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some drastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our experiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and 60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13175v1" target="_blank">Novel Demonstration Generation with Gaussian Splatting Enables Robust   One-Shot Manipulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sizhe Yang, Wenye Yu, Jia Zeng, Jun Lv, Kerui Ren, Cewu Lu, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
            <p>Visuomotor policies learned from teleoperated demonstrations face challenges such as lengthy data collection, high costs, and limited data diversity. Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13174v1" target="_blank">Quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations based on   physics-informed effective Hamiltonians</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hsin-Yu Wu, Annie E. Paine, Evan Philip, Antonio A. Gentile, Oleksandr Kyriienko</p>
            <p>We propose a distinct approach to solving linear and nonlinear differential equations (DEs) on quantum computers by encoding the problem into ground states of effective Hamiltonian operators. Our algorithm relies on constructing such operators in the Chebyshev space, where an effective Hamiltonian is a sum of global differential and data constraints. Once the effective Hamiltonian is formed, solutions of differential equations can be obtained using the ground state preparation techniques (e.g. imaginary-time evolution and quantum singular value transformation), bypassing variational search. Unlike approaches based on discrete grids, the algorithm enables evaluation of solutions beyond fixed grid points and implements constraints in the physics-informed way. Our proposal inherits the best traits from quantum machine learning-based DE solving (compact basis representation, automatic differentiation, nonlinearity) and quantum linear algebra-based approaches (fine-grid encoding, provable speed-up for state preparation), offering a robust strategy for quantum scientific computing in the early fault-tolerant era.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13168v1" target="_blank">Restoring Heisenberg scaling in time via autonomous quantum error   correction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyukgun Kwon, Uwe R. Fischer, Seung-Woo Lee, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>We establish a sufficient condition under which autonomous quantum error correction (AutoQEC) can effectively restore Heisenberg scaling (HS) in quantum metrology. Specifically, we show that if all Lindblad operators associated with the noise commute with the signal Hamiltonian and a particular constrained linear equation admits a solution, then an ancilla-free AutoQEC scheme with finite $R$ (where $R$ represents the ratio between the engineered dissipation rate for AutoQEC and the noise rate,) can approximately preserve HS with desired small additive error $\epsilon > 0$ over any time interval $0 \leq t \leq T$. We emphasize that the error scales as $ \epsilon = O(\kappa T / R^c) $ with $c \geq 1$, indicating that the required $R$ decreases significantly with increasing $c$ to achieve a desired error. Furthermore, we discuss that if the sufficient condition is not satisfied, logical errors may be induced that cannot be efficiently corrected by the canonical AutoQEC framework. Finally, we numerically verify our analytical results by employing the concrete example of phase estimation under dephasing noise.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13166v1" target="_blank">Topologically enabled superconductivity: possible implications for   rhombohedral graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Paoletti, Daniele Guerci, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Urban F. P. Seifert, Elio J. König</p>
            <p>We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13164v1" target="_blank">Minute-long quantum coherence enabled by electrical depletion of   magnetic noise</a></h3>

            <p>Integrating solid-state spin defects into classical electronic devices can enable new opportunities for quantum information processing that benefit from existing semiconductor technology. We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results demonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to create highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13163v1" target="_blank">Experimental Verification of Electron-Photon Entanglement</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Preimesberger, Sergei Bogdanov, Isobel C. Bicket, Phila Rembold, Philipp Haslinger</p>
            <p>Entanglement, a key resource of emerging quantum technologies, describes correlations between particles that defy classical physics. It has been studied extensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations. Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of the classical uncertainty bound: $\Delta x_-^2 \Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \pm 0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields of electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring quantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to quantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13156v1" target="_blank">Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofia P. Corbà</p>
            <p>An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13154v1" target="_blank">Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode   Polarization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. I. Lonappan, B. Keating, K. Arnold</p>
            <p>Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} < 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13150v1" target="_blank">Readable Twins of Unreadable Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Pancerz, Piotr Kulicki, Michał Kalisz, Andrzej Burda, Maciej Stanisławski, Jaromir Sarzyński</p>
            <p>Creating responsible artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an important issue in contemporary research and development of works on AI. One of the characteristics of responsible AI systems is their explainability. In the paper, we are interested in explainable deep learning (XDL) systems. On the basis of the creation of digital twins of physical objects, we introduce the idea of creating readable twins (in the form of imprecise information flow models) for unreadable deep learning models. The complete procedure for switching from the deep learning model (DLM) to the imprecise information flow model (IIFM) is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example of a deep learning classification model for image recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.</p>
