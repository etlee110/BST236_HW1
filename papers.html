            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16427v1" target="_blank">On the Holographic Dual of a Symmetry Operator at Finite Temperature</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner, Chitraang Murdia</p>
            <p>Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT$_D$ and the evaluation of gravitational saddles in the presence of a dynamical brane. Expectation values of $0$-form symmetry operators in the CFT$_D$ are then related to branes wrapped on volume minimizing cycles in the bulk, i.e., the Euclidean continuation of a black hole horizon. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS$_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16417v1" target="_blank">A Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) approach for   molecules in QED environments</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Alessandro, Henrik Koch, Enrico Ronca</p>
            <p>Multireference systems are usually challenging to investigate using ab initio methods as they require an accurate description of static electron correlation. The urgency of developing similar approaches is even more pressing when molecules strongly interact with light in quantum-electrodynamics (QED) environments. In fact, in this context, multireference effects might be induced or reduced by the presence of the field. In this work, we extend the Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) approach to polaritonic systems. The method is tested on benchmark multireference problems and applied to investigate field-induced effects on the electronic structure of well-known multiconfigurational processes. We analyze the strengths and limitations of the method with particular attention to the appearance of possible origin dependencies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16415v1" target="_blank">Apparent $w<-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons   Interactions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Khoury, Meng-Xiang Lin, Mark Trodden</p>
            <p>We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$<-1$ to a present-day value~$>-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16410v1" target="_blank">Simultaneous transport and tunneling spectroscopy of moiré graphene:   Distinct observation of the superconducting gap and signatures of nodal   superconductivity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeong Min Park, Shuwen Sun, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero</p>
            <p>Understanding the nature of superconductivity in magic-angle graphene remains challenging. A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report the first simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle graphene, providing a novel approach to probe the superconducting state. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work reveals the unconventional nature of the superconducting gap in magic-angle graphene and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16409v1" target="_blank">A foundational derivation of quantum weak values and time-dependent   density functional theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Russell B. Thompson, Zarin Tasneem, Yves Caudano</p>
            <p>The equations of time-dependent density functional theory are derived, via the expression for the quantum weak value, from ring polymer quantum theory using a symmetry between time and imaginary time. The imaginary time path integral formalism of Feynman, in which inverse temperature is seen to be a Wick rotation of time, allows one to write the equilibrium partition function of a quantum system in a form isomorphic with the path integral expression for the dynamics. Therefore the self-consistent field theory equations which are solutions to the equilibrium partition function are Wick rotated back into a set of dynamic equations, which are shown to give the formula for the quantum weak value. As a special case, this in turn reduces to the equations of time-dependent density functional theory. This first-principles derivation does not use the theorems of density functional theory, which are instead applied to guarantee equivalence with standard quantum mechanics. An expression for finite-temperature dynamics is also derived using the limits of the equilibrium equations and the ground state dynamics. This finite temperature expression shows that a ring polymer model for quantum particles holds for time-dependent systems as well as static situations. Issues arising in time-dependent density functional theory, such as causality, initial state dependence, and $v$-representability, are discussed in the context of the ring polymer derivation. Connections with a variety of quantum phenomena is reviewed, and a possible link with de Broglie-Bohm theory is mentioned.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16408v1" target="_blank">RoboFactory: Exploring Embodied Agent Collaboration with Compositional   Constraints</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiran Qin, Li Kang, Xiufeng Song, Zhenfei Yin, Xiaohong Liu, Xihui Liu, Ruimao Zhang, Lei Bai</p>
            <p>Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning, aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03409v2" target="_blank">Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by   correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari</p>
            <p>In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16405v1" target="_blank">Acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants, long-range correlations,   and the antiproton puzzle</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Bzdak, Volker Koch, Volodymyr Vovchenko</p>
            <p>We analyze joint factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and point out that they obey the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p\rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$ as a function of acceptance when only long-range correlations are present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons, $-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 > -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2$, indicating that global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations alone cannot explain the data. We also discuss high-order factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within phase II of RHIC-BES.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19293v3" target="_blank">Longitudinal short-distance constraints on hadronic light-by-light   scattering and tensor meson contributions to the muon $g-2$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Mager, Luigi Cappiello, Josef Leutgeb, Anton Rebhan</p>
            <p>Short-distance constraints from the operator product expansion in QCD play an important role in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While conventional hadronic models involving a finite number of resonances fail to reproduce the correct power laws implied by them, holographic QCD has been shown to naturally incorporate the Melnikov-Vainshtein constraint on the longitudinal amplitude following from the triangle anomaly in the asymmetric limit, where one photon virtuality remains small compared to the others. This is saturated by an infinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the muon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive analysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance constraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the level of 81\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to the muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap, because in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only contributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint. Numerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the low-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a negligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining gap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete hadronic light-by-light contribution.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20881v2" target="_blank">Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Cipriani, Alessandro De Santis, Giorgio Di Russo, Alfredo Grillo, Luca Tabarroni</p>
            <p>The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</p>
