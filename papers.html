            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20044v1" target="_blank">How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Jana, Michael Klasen, Vishnu P. K</p>
            <p>We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance. Instead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination of $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)_X$ symmetry is embedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries, such as $X = L_\alpha - L_\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data. In contrast, we have shown that only flavor-universal $U(1)_X$ symmetries-such as $U(1)_{B-L}$, which shifts both quark and lepton charges, and $U(1)_L$, which modifies only the lepton sector-can generate tiny neutrino charges consistent with observed masses and mixing. We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing the phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that constraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U(1)_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach, as is often the case.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20045v1" target="_blank">Up-type FCNC in presence of Dark Matter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhaditya Bhattacharya, Lipika Kolay, Dipankar Pradhan, Abhik Sarkar</p>
            <p>Dark Matter (DM) is a known unknown. Apart, current experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes involving up-type quarks also provide scope to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this article, we establish a connection between the flavor sector and the DM sector with minimal extension of the SM. Here a singlet complex scalar field, stable under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, acts as DM and couples to SM up-type quarks through a heavy Dirac vector-like quark (VLQ), which shares the same $\mathbb{Z}_3$ charge as of the DM. The model thus addresses the observed $D^0-\bar{D^0}$ mixing, top-FCNC interactions, and $D^0$ meson decays, together with DM relic density, while evading the direct and indirect DM search bounds. The model can be probed at the future high-energy muon collider, through distinctive signatures of VLQ production, where the VLQ decays into DM and SM particles, abiding by the existing bounds.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20046v1" target="_blank">On the Properties of Cosmological Ionization Fronts</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanjue Zhu, Nickolay Y. Gnedin</p>
            <p>We investigate the properties of cosmological ionization fronts during the Epoch of Reionization using the CROC simulations. By analyzing reionization timing maps, we characterize ionization front velocities and curvatures and their dependence on the density structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The velocity distribution of ionization fronts in the simulations indicates that while the barrier-crossing analytical model captures the overall shape in high-velocity regions, it fails to reproduce the low-velocity tail, highlighting the non-Gaussian nature of the IGM's density field. Ionization front velocities are inversely correlated with local density, propagating faster in underdense regions and more slowly in overdense environments. Faster ionization fronts also lead to higher post-ionization temperatures, reaching a plateau at $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ K for velocities exceeding 3000 km/s. Examining curvature statistics further establishes a connection between ionization front structure and the normalized density contrast $\nu$, with trends in overdense regions aligning well with barrier-crossing model predictions, while deviations appear in underdense environments due to model limitations. These results provide a detailed characterization of ionization front dynamics and their interaction with the underlying density field, bridging small-scale reionization physics with large-scale observables such as the 21 cm signal and the IGM's thermal history.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20043v1" target="_blank">Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter   models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Ellis, Malcolm Fairbairn, Juan Urrutia, Ville Vaskonen</p>
            <p>We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $> 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $> 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $> 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a < 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ of DM in the range $10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 \,M_{\odot})^{-0.09} < f_{\rm PBH} < 8.7\times 10^{-3} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4\, M_{\odot})^{-1}$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01467v2" target="_blank">On Exact Sizes of Minimal CNOT Circuits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens Emil Christensen, Søren Fuglede Jørgensen, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Jaco van de Pol</p>
            <p>Computing a minimum-size circuit that implements a certain function is a standard optimization task. We consider circuits of CNOT gates, which are fundamental binary gates in reversible and quantum computing. Algebraically, CNOT circuits on $n$ qubits correspond to $GL(n,2)$, the general linear group over the field of two elements, and circuit minimization reduces to computing distances in the Cayley graph $G_n$ of $GL(n,2)$ generated by transvections. However, the super-exponential size of $GL(n,2)$ has made its exploration computationally challenging.   In this paper, we develop a new approach for computing distances in $G_n$, allowing us to synthesize minimum circuits that were previously beyond reach (e.g., we can synthesize optimally all circuits over $n=7$ qubits). Towards this, we establish two theoretical results that may be of independent interest. First, we give a complete characterization of all isometries in $G_n$ in terms of (i) permuting qubits and (ii) swapping the arguments of all CNOT gates. Second, for any fixed $d$, we establish polynomials in $n$ of degree $2d$ that characterize the size of spheres in $G_n$ at distance $d$, as long as $n\geq 2d$. With these tools, we revisit an open question of [Bataille, 2022] regarding the smallest number $n_0$ for which the diameter of $G_{n_0}$ exceeds $3(n_0-1)$. It was previously shown that $6\leq n_0 \leq 30$, a gap that we tighten considerably to $8\leq n_0 \leq 20$. We also confirm a conjecture that long cycle permutations lie at distance $3(n-1)$, for all $n\leq 8$, extending the previous bound of $n\leq 5$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17773v2" target="_blank">Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20028v1" target="_blank">Textured growth and electrical characterization of Zinc Sulfide on   back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) compatible substrates</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claire Wu, Mythili Surendran, Anika Tabassum Priyoti, Gokul Anilkumar, Cheng-Hsien Wu, Chun-Chen Wang, Cheng-Chen Kuo, Harish Kumasubramanian, Kenta Lin, Amari Butler, Rehan Kapadia, Xinyu Bao, Jayakanth Ravichandran</p>
            <p>Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450{\deg}C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400{\deg}C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17214v2" target="_blank">Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux   Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Timofeyev, Alexey Schwarzmann, Dmitri Kuzmin</p>
            <p>We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20021v1" target="_blank">Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time   reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan C. Spieler</p>
            <p>We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08359v2" target="_blank">Proposal for an autonomous quantum heat engine</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miika Rasola, Vasilii Vadimov, Tuomas Uusnäkki, Mikko Möttönen</p>
            <p>We propose and theoretically analyse a superconducting electric circuit which can be used to experimentally realize an autonomous quantum heat engine. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave power generation can emerge solely from the heat flow through the circuit determined by non-linear circuit quantum electrodynamics. The predicted energy generation rate is sufficiently high for its experimental observation with contemporary techniques, rendering this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on Otto cycles.</p>
