            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07098v1" target="_blank">Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact   solutions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07094v1" target="_blank">Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers:   Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Slongo, Cristian Micheletti</p>
            <p>We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07095v1" target="_blank">Neural Motion Simulator: Pushing the Limit of World Models in   Reinforcement Learning</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenjie Hao, Weyl Lu, Yifan Xu, Yubei Chen</p>
            <p>An embodied system must not only model the patterns of the external world but also understand its own motion dynamics. A motion dynamic model is essential for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning. Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities. Our findings highlight that world models for motion dynamics is a promising direction for developing more versatile and capable embodied systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02583v5" target="_blank">A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton   coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Ky Nguyen</p>
            <p>We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01017v2" target="_blank">Scalable quantum neural networks by few quantum resources</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Pastorello, Enrico Blanzieri</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the construction of a general parametric model that can be implemented executing multiple swap tests over few qubits and applying a suitable measurement protocol. The model turns out to be equivalent to a two-layer feedforward neural network which can be realized combining small quantum modules. The advantages and the perspectives of the proposed quantum method are discussed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21762v2" target="_blank">On the open TS/ST correspondence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matijn Fran√ßois, Alba Grassi</p>
            <p>The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11583v2" target="_blank">Distributional Autoencoders Know the Score</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrej Leban</p>
            <p>This work presents novel and desirable properties of a recently introduced class of autoencoders - the Distributional Principal Autoencoder (DPA) - which combines distributionally correct reconstruction with principal components-like interpretability of the encodings. First, we show formally that the level sets of the encoder orient themselves exactly with regard to the score of the data distribution. This both explains the method's often remarkable performance in disentangling the factors of variation of the data, as well as opens up possibilities of recovering its distribution while having access to samples only. In settings where the score itself has physical meaning - such as when the data obeys the Boltzmann distribution - we demonstrate that the method can recover scientifically important quantities such as the minimum free energy path. Second, we prove that if the data lies on a manifold that can be approximated by the encoder, the optimal encoder's components beyond the dimension of the manifold will carry absolutely no additional information about the data distribution. This promises potentially new ways of determining the number of relevant dimensions of the data. The results thus demonstrate that the DPA elegantly combines two often disparate goals of unsupervised learning: the learning of the data distribution and the learning of the intrinsic data dimensionality.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07077v1" target="_blank">Machine Learning Approach towards Quantum Error Mitigation for Accurate   Molecular Energetics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srushti Patil, Dibyendu Mondal, Rahul Maitra</p>
            <p>Despite significant efforts, the realization of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithms has predominantly been confined to proof-of-principles, mainly due to the hardware noise. With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term goal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM) techniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has been a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training data is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the computational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in predicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19001v2" target="_blank">Impact of resummation on the production and experimental bounds of   scalar high-electric-charge objects</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Alexandre, Nick E. Mavromatos, Vasiliki A. Mitsou, Emanuela Musumeci</p>
            <p>A one-loop Dyson-Schwinger-like resummation scheme is applied to scalar High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs), extending previous work on spin-1/2 case. The electromagnetic interactions of HECOs are considered within the framework of strongly coupled scalar Quantun Electrodynamics. The resummation amounts to determining non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed points, at which the effective Lagrangian, which will lead to the pertinent predictions on the cross sections, is computed. In contrast to the fermionic HECO case, in which the fixed point structure was determined solely by the interactions of the HECOs with the photon field, in the scalar case the existence of non-trivial UV fixed points requires the presence of additional strong self interactions among the HECOs. Our resummation scheme, which is notably different from a lattice strong-coupling approach, makes the computation of the pertinent scalar-HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing revisiting the mass bounds obtained from searches for such objects in current or future colliders. Our MadGraph implementation of the results leads to enhanced (up to ~30%) lower bounds on the mass of scalar HECOs, as compared to those extracted from the tree-level processes typically used in LHC collider searches by ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07073v1" target="_blank">New empirical mass-loss recipe for UV radiation line-driven winds of hot   stars across various metallicities</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Pauli, L. M. Oskinova, W. -R. Hamann, A. A. C. Sander, Jorick S. Vink, M. Bernini-Peron, J. Josiek, R. R. Lefever, H. Sana, V. Ramachandran</p>
            <p>The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar evolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used to determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate ($\Delta$log($\dot{M}$/(M$_\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.</p>
