            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21502v1" target="_blank">Generalizable and Relightable Gaussian Splatting for Human Novel View   Synthesis</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yipengjing Sun, Chenyang Wang, Shunyuan Zheng, Zonglin Li, Shengping Zhang, Xiangyang Ji</p>
            <p>We propose GRGS, a generalizable and relightable 3D Gaussian framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis under diverse lighting conditions. Unlike existing methods that rely on per-character optimization or ignore physical constraints, GRGS adopts a feed-forward, fully supervised strategy that projects geometry, material, and illumination cues from multi-view 2D observations into 3D Gaussian representations. Specifically, to reconstruct lighting-invariant geometry, we introduce a Lighting-aware Geometry Refinement (LGR) module trained on synthetically relit data to predict accurate depth and surface normals. Based on the high-quality geometry, a Physically Grounded Neural Rendering (PGNR) module is further proposed to integrate neural prediction with physics-based shading, supporting editable relighting with shadows and indirect illumination. Besides, we design a 2D-to-3D projection training scheme that leverages differentiable supervision from ambient occlusion, direct, and indirect lighting maps, which alleviates the computational cost of explicit ray tracing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRGS achieves superior visual quality, geometric consistency, and generalization across characters and lighting conditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21498v1" target="_blank">Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three   Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishi G. Gopalakrishnan, Binayyak B. Roy, Gargee Sharma, Sumanta Tewari</p>
            <p>We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16533v2" target="_blank">Visualization of time-frequency structures in gravitational wave signals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chad Henshaw, Megan Arogeti, Alice Heranval, Laura Cadonati</p>
            <p>The gravitational wave signals produced by the coalescence of compact binaries progress through three stages: inspiral, merger, and postmerger. The evolution of their frequency follows a slow build up during the inspiral that peaks at merger, forming the characteristic "chirp" pattern in the signal's time-frequency map. Herein we introduce a framework for localizing further characteristic structures in the time-frequency space of gravitational wave signals using the continuous wavelet transform. We consider two example cases where there are specific patterns in the postmerger stage of the signal that are rich with information on the physical nature of the source: highly-inclined black hole binaries with asymmetric mass ratio, and neutron star binaries with postmerger remnant oscillations. It is demonstrated that the choice of quality factor $Q$ plays a central role in distinguishing the postmerger features from that of the inspiral, with black hole systems preferring lower $Q$ and neutron star systems preferring higher $Q$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of chirplets as the wavelet transform basis, which allow for manipulation of structure in the time-frequency map.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21489v1" target="_blank">5-Dimensional Gravitational Raman Scattering: Scalar Wave Perturbations   in Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Spacetime</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samim Akhtar, Yilber Fabian Bautista, Cristoforo Iossa, Zihan Zhou</p>
            <p>In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the 5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function for the reduced confluent Heun problem. Furthermore, up to $O(G^2)$ we compute the dynamical $\ell=0$, and the static $\ell=1$, scalar tidal Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description for a scalar wave scattering off the black hole, to our novel ultraviolet-NS solutions. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21485v1" target="_blank">Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions   in fractional dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Calcagni, Giuseppe Nardelli</p>
            <p>We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ in Lorentzian signature and pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. This self-adjoint fractional d'Alembertian is associated with complex-conjugate poles, which are removed from the physical spectrum via the Anselmi-Piva prescription. As an example of empty spectrum, we consider a purely fractional propagator and its K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d'Alembertian, showing that the number of initial conditions is two. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21481v1" target="_blank">Probing the quantum motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a   radio-frequency superconducting qubit</a></h3>

            <p>Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</p>

            <p>We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9\%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\mu^\text{SM} = 116\,592\,033(62)\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-3 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\mu^\text{exp} - a_\mu^\text{SM} =26(66)\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 is expected to be around 140 ppb, which is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20547v4" target="_blank">Annealing Flow Generative Models Towards Sampling High-Dimensional and   Multi-Modal Distributions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongze Wu, Yao Xie</p>
            <p>Sampling from high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics-based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow (AF), a method built on Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) for sampling from high-dimensional and multi-modal distributions. AF is trained with a dynamic Optimal Transport (OT) objective incorporating Wasserstein regularization, and guided by annealing procedures, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high-dimensional spaces. Compared to recent NF methods, AF greatly improves training efficiency and stability, with minimal reliance on MC assistance. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state-of-the-art methods through experiments on various challenging distributions and real-world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multi-modal settings. We also highlight AF potential for sampling the least favorable distributions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21469v1" target="_blank">PropMolFlow: Property-guided Molecule Generation with Geometry-Complete   Flow Matching</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Zeng, Jirui Jin, George Karypis, Mark Transtrum, Ellad B. Tadmor, Richard G. Hennig, Adrian Roitberg, Stefano Martiniani, Mingjie Liu</p>
            <p>Molecule generation is advancing rapidly in chemical discovery and drug design. Flow matching methods have recently set the state of the art (SOTA) in unconditional molecule generation, surpassing score-based diffusion models. However, diffusion models still lead in property-guided generation. In this work, we introduce PropMolFlow, a novel approach for property-guided molecule generation based on geometry-complete SE(3)-equivariant flow matching. Integrating five different property embedding methods with a Gaussian expansion of scalar properties, PropMolFlow outperforms previous SOTA diffusion models in conditional molecule generation across various properties while preserving the stability and validity of the generated molecules, consistent with its unconditional counterpart. Additionally, it enables faster inference with significantly fewer time steps compared to baseline models. We highlight the importance of validating the properties of generated molecules through DFT calculations performed at the same level of theory as the training data. Specifically, our analysis identifies properties that require DFT validation and others where a pretrained SE(3) geometric vector perceptron regressors provide sufficiently accurate predictions on generated molecules. Furthermore, we introduce a new property metric designed to assess the model's ability to propose molecules with underrepresented property values, assessing its capacity for out-of-distribution generalization. Our findings reveal shortcomings in existing structural metrics, which mistakenly validate open-shell molecules or molecules with invalid valence-charge configurations, underscoring the need for improved evaluation frameworks. Overall, this work paves the way for developing targeted property-guided generation methods, enhancing the design of molecular generative models for diverse applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05219v2" target="_blank">Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam J. Scanlon, Santosh Bhusal, Christina M. Hoffmann, Junhong He, Sean R. Parkin, Brennan J. Arnold, William J. Gannon</p>
            <p>Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</p>
