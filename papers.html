            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08788v1" target="_blank">GNN-based Precoder Design and Fine-tuning for Cell-free Massive MIMO   with Real-world CSI</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianzheng Miao, Thomas Feys, Gilles Callebaut, Jarne Van Mulders, Emanuele Peschiera, Md Arifur Rahman, François Rottenberg</p>
            <p>Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising paradigm for delivering uniformly high-quality coverage in future wireless networks. To address the inherent challenges of precoding in such distributed systems, recent studies have explored the use of graph neural network (GNN)-based methods, using their powerful representation capabilities. However, these approaches have predominantly been trained and validated on synthetic datasets, leaving their generalizability to real-world propagation environments largely unverified. In this work, we initially pre-train the GNN using simulated channel state information (CSI) data, which incorporates standard propagation models and small-scale Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we finetune the model on real-world CSI measurements collected from a physical testbed equipped with distributed access points (APs). To balance the retention of pre-trained features with adaptation to real-world conditions, we adopt a layer-freezing strategy during fine-tuning, wherein several GNN layers are frozen and only the later layers remain trainable. Numerical results demonstrate that the fine-tuned GNN significantly outperforms the pre-trained model, achieving an approximate 8.2 bits per channel use gain at 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), corresponding to a 15.7 % improvement. These findings highlight the critical role of transfer learning and underscore the potential of GNN-based precoding techniques to effectively generalize from synthetic to real-world wireless environments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00211v2" target="_blank">Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the   vector fluctuations of the electron star</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladan Gecin, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05388v2" target="_blank">On-Chip Parametric Synchronization of a Dissipative Kerr Soliton   Microcomb</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Moille, Pradyoth Shandilya, Miro Erkintalo, Curtis R. Menyuk, Kartik Srinivasan</p>
            <p>Synchronization of oscillators is ubiquitous in nature. Often, the synchronized oscillators couple directly, yet in some cases synchronization can arise from their parametric interactions. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the parametric synchronization of a dissipative Kerr soliton frequency comb. We specifically show that the parametric interaction between the soliton and two auxiliary lasers permits the entrainment of the frequency comb repetition rate. Besides representing the first prediction and demonstration of parametric synchronization of soliton frequency combs, our scheme offers significant flexibility for all-optical metrological-scale stabilization of the comb.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08787v1" target="_blank">UniSkill: Imitating Human Videos via Cross-Embodiment Skill   Representations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanjung Kim, Jaehyun Kang, Hyolim Kang, Meedeum Cho, Seon Joo Kim, Youngwoon Lee</p>
            <p>Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01577v2" target="_blank">Broadband Visible Wavelength Microcomb Generation In Silicon Nitride   Microrings Through Air-Clad Dispersion Engineering</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Moille, Daron Westly, Rahul Shrestha, Khoi Tuan Hoang, Kartik Srinivasan</p>
            <p>The development of broadband microresonator frequency combs at visible wavelengths is pivotal for the advancement of compact and fieldable optical atomic clocks and spectroscopy systems. Yet, their realization necessitates resonators with anomalous dispersion, an arduous task due to the prevailing normal dispersion regime of materials within the visible spectrum. In this work, we evince that silicon nitride microring resonators with air cladding on top and sides -- a deviation from the frequently employed silica-embedded resonators -- allows for the direct generation of broadband microcombs in the visible range. We experimentally demonstrate combs pumped at 1060~nm (283~THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 680~nm (440 THz), and combs pumped at 780~nm (384 THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 630 nm (475 THz). We further show through simulations that microcombs extending to wavelengths as low as 461 nm (650 THz) should be accessible in this platform.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08786v1" target="_blank">Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anish Ghoshal, Nobuchika Okada, Arnab Paul</p>
            <p>Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w > 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08785v1" target="_blank">Divisible and indivisible Stochastic-Quantum dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leandro Silva Pimenta</p>
            <p>This work presents a complete geometrical characterisation of divisible and indivisible time-evolution at the level of probabilities for systems with two configurations, open or closed. Our new geometrical construction in the space of stochastic matrices shows the existence of conical bounds separating divisible and indivisible dynamics, bearing analogy with the relativistic causal structure, with an emerging time pointing towards information erasure when the dynamics are divisible. Indivisible dynamics, which include quantum dynamics, are characterised by a time-flow against the information-erasure time coordinate or by being tachyonic with respect to the cones in the stochastic matrix space. This provides a geometric counterpart of other results in the literature, such as the equivalence between information-decreasing and divisible processes. The results apply under minimal assumptions: (i) the system has two configurations, (ii) one can freely ascribe initial probabilities to both and (iii) probabilities at other times are linearly related to the initial ones through conditional probabilities. The optional assumption of (iv) continuity places further constraints on the system, removing one of the past cones. Discontinuous stochastic dynamics in continuous time include cases with divisible blocks of evolution which are not themselves divisible. We show that the connection between continuity and multiplicity of divisors holds for any dimension. We extend methods of coarse graining and dilations by incorporating dynamics and uncertainty, connecting them with divisibility criteria. This is a first step towards a full geometric characterisation of indivisible stochastic dynamics for any number of configurations which, as they cannot at the level of probabilities be reduced to a composition of evolution operators, constitute fundamental elements of probabilistic time-evolution.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08783v1" target="_blank">CodePDE: An Inference Framework for LLM-driven PDE Solver Generation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanda Li, Tanya Marwah, Junhong Shen, Weiwei Sun, Andrej Risteski, Yiming Yang, Ameet Talwalkar</p>
            <p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical systems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical solvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally expensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets and often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code generation task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for generating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and test-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves superhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also present a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing their accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings highlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving, offering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model development.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08779v1" target="_blank">Exotic Carriers from Concentrated Topology: Dirac Trions as the Origin   of the Missing Spectral Weight in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick J. Ledwith, Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The nature of charge carriers in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near $\nu = -2$, where superconductivity emerges, remains mysterious. While various symmetry-broken ground states have been proposed, experimental evidence of significant entropy persisting to low temperatures suggests that the disordered thermal state is a more natural starting point for understanding the normal state physics. Our previous work proposed that this thermal state in TBG hosts nearly decoupled nonlocal moments and an exotic Mott semimetal at charge neutrality. This evolves into a spectrally imbalanced Mott state at non-zero integer fillings. Notably, at $\nu = -2$, the quasiparticle residue vanishes at the top of the valence band, precisely where superconductivity develops. The vanishing quasiparticle residue naturally leads to the following question: Which excitation accounts for the missing spectral weight, and how are they related to electrons? In this work, we demonstrate that the missing spectral weight corresponds to a trion excitation, which we explicitly construct and characterize. Remarkably, despite being composed of heavy particles away from the Gamma point, this trion is unexpectedly light. At charge neutrality, the electron and trion hybridize with a momentum-dependent phase that winds around zero, forming a massless Dirac cone. At finite doping $\nu < 0$, the Dirac cone acquires a mass with the valence (conduction) band becoming trion (electron)-like near the $\Gamma$ point. Finally, we show that such trion excitations evolve into the quasiparticles of the intervalley Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) state at finite doping, where they represent electrons dressed by the IKS order parameter. More broadly, our work highlights the unusual spectral properties and excitations that emerge when fermions interact within topological bands with concentrated quantum geometry and topology.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08776v1" target="_blank">Electroweak hierarchy from conformal and custodial symmetry --   "Custodial Naturalness"</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Trautner</p>
            <p>I introduce the idea of "Custodial Naturalness" to explain the origin of the electroweak (EW) scale hierarchy. Custodial Naturalness is based on classical scale invariance as well as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector custodial symmetry. In a minimal realization, this requires a single new complex scalar field charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry, which partially overlaps with $B-L$. Classical scale invariance and the high-scale scalar sector SO(6) custodial symmetry are radiatively broken by quantum effects that generate a new intermediate scale by dimensional transmutation. The little hierarchy problem is solved because the Higgs boson arises as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of the spontaneously broken SO(6) custodial symmetry. The minimal realization of Custodial Naturalness has the same number of parameters as the SM and predicts testable new physics in the form of a heavy $Z'$ as well as a light but close-to invisible dilaton.</p>
