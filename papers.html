            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17362v1" target="_blank">Criteria for unbiased estimation: applications to noise-agnostic sensing   and learnability of quantum channel</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyukgun Kwon, Kento Tsubouchi, Chia-Tung Chu, Liang Jiang</p>
            <p>We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for unbiased estimation in multi-parameter estimation tasks. More specifically, we first consider quantum state estimation, where multiple parameters are encoded in a quantum state, and derive two equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for an unbiased estimation: one formulated in terms of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) and the other based on the derivatives of the encoded state. Furthermore, we introduce a generalized quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, which provides a fundamental achievable lower bound on the estimation error even when the QFIM is non-invertible. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we consider phase estimation under unknown Pauli noise. We show that while unbiased phase estimation is infeasible with a naive scheme, employing an entangled probe with a noiseless ancilla enables unbiased estimation. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum channel estimation (equivalently, quantum channel learning), where the goal is to estimate parameters characterizing an unknown quantum channel. We establish the necessary and sufficient condition for unbiased estimation of these parameters. Notably, by interpreting unbiased estimation as learnability, our result applies to the fundamental learnability of parameters in general quantum channels. As a concrete application, we investigate the learnability of noise affecting non-Clifford gates via cycle benchmarking.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17360v1" target="_blank">Plasma treated metals after H- irradiation and its effect on vacuum   breakdown behaviour</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Serafim, S. Calatroni, F. Djurabekova, M. C. Giordano, M. Himmerlich, V. Bjelland, C. Kouzios, P. Costa Pinto, A. T. Perez-Fontenla, W. Wuensch, A. Grudiev, S. Sgobba</p>
            <p>Vacuum breakdown in accelerator structures is a critical challenge that occurs under high electric fields. In environments subjected to hydrogen ion irradiation or high beam losses, such as in Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ), residual hydrocarbons from the vacuum may result in carbon contamination of the metal surfaces from charged particle induced cracking. Under these conditions, it has been assessed that surface carbon contamination leads to a decrement of the surface electric field holding properties. This study extends the latest research by exploring the efficacy of Oxygen Plasma Cleaning (OPC) on metal electrodes irradiated by low energy hydrogen ion beam with the purpose of reducing surface carbon contamination. OPC treatment has been employed on different metals, namely copper beryllium (CuBe2), oxygen-free copper (Cu-OFE), and stainless steel (SS316LN). Treated electrodes have been tested for electric field performance in a DC pulsed system and results compared with non-irradiated electrodes and irradiated ones without OPC treatment. The study indicates a significant reduction in carbon contamination by OPC, enough to allow irradiated materials to achieve performances comparable with the electric field strength of raw surfaces. Moreover, it has been observed that stainless steel samples had some alteration in the surface chemistry that enhanced the materials ability to sustain high electric fields while decreasing vacuum arcing events. Notably, OPC treated SS316LN electrodes surpassed the performance value of untreated ones, demonstrating the potential of plasma treatments in extending the operational performance of accelerator components.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17359v1" target="_blank">Position: Interactive Generative Video as Next-Generation Game Engine</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwen Yu, Yiran Qin, Haoxuan Che, Quande Liu, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Xihui Liu</p>
            <p>Modern game development faces significant challenges in creativity and cost due to predetermined content in traditional game engines. Recent breakthroughs in video generation models, capable of synthesizing realistic and interactive virtual environments, present an opportunity to revolutionize game creation. In this position paper, we propose Interactive Generative Video (IGV) as the foundation for Generative Game Engines (GGE), enabling unlimited novel content generation in next-generation gaming. GGE leverages IGV's unique strengths in unlimited high-quality content synthesis, physics-aware world modeling, user-controlled interactivity, long-term memory capabilities, and causal reasoning. We present a comprehensive framework detailing GGE's core modules and a hierarchical maturity roadmap (L0-L4) to guide its evolution. Our work charts a new course for game development in the AI era, envisioning a future where AI-powered generative systems fundamentally reshape how games are created and experienced.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17357v1" target="_blank">Filtered Rayleigh-Ritz is all you need</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Abbott, Daniel C. Hackett, George T. Fleming, Dimitra A. Pefkou, Michael L. Wagman</p>
            <p>Recent work has shown that the (block) Lanczos algorithm can be used to extract approximate energy spectra and matrix elements from (matrices of) correlation functions in quantum field theory, and identified exact coincidences between Lanczos analysis methods and others. In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger "Prony-Ritz equivalence class", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17356v1" target="_blank">Fast Convex Optimization with Quantum Gradient Methods</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Augustino, Dylan Herman, Enrico Fontana, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Jacob Watkins, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>We study quantum algorithms based on quantum (sub)gradient estimation using noisy evaluation oracles, and demonstrate the first dimension independent query complexities (up to poly-logarithmic factors) for zeroth-order convex optimization in both smooth and nonsmooth settings. We match the first-order query complexities of classical gradient descent, using only noisy evaluation oracles, thereby exhibiting exponential separation between quantum and classical zeroth-order optimization. Specifically, for the smooth case, zeroth-order quantum gradient descent achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(LR^2/\varepsilon)$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \kappa \log(1/\varepsilon \right))$ query complexities, for the convex and strongly convex case respectively; for the nonsmooth case, the zeroth-order quantum subgradient method attains a query complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((GR/\varepsilon)^2 )$. We then generalize these algorithms to work in non-Euclidean settings by using quantum (sub)gradient estimation to instantiate mirror descent, dual averaging and mirror prox.   We demonstrate how our algorithm for nonsmooth optimization can be applied to solve an SDP involving $m$ constraints and $n \times n$ matrices to additive error $\varepsilon$ using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} ((mn^2+n^{\omega})(Rr/\varepsilon)^2)$ gates, where $\omega \in [2,2.38)$ is the exponent of matrix-multiplication time and $R$ and $r$ are bounds on the primal and dual optimal solutions, respectively. Specializing to linear programs, we obtain a quantum LP solver with complexity $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((m+\sqrt{n}) (Rr/\varepsilon)^2).$ For zero-sum games we achieve the best quantum runtimes for any $\varepsilon > 0$ when $m = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. We obtain the best algorithm overall (quantum or classical) whenever we further impose $\varepsilon=\Omega((m+n)^{-1/4})$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09328v2" target="_blank">Schrödinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henri Orland</p>
            <p>A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</p>

            <p>We obtain rigorous large time asymptotics for the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the soliton free case by extending the nonlinear steepest descent method to genus 1 surfaces. The methods presented in this paper pave the way to a rigorous analysis of other integrable equations on the torus and enable asymptotic analysis on different regimes of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17346v1" target="_blank">Abundances of refractory ions in Beta Pictoris exocomets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Vrignaud, A. Lecavelier des Etangs, P. A. Strom, F. Kiefer</p>
            <p>Beta Pic is a young, A5V star, known for harbouring a large number of exocomets, which frequently transit the star and produce absorption signatures. The physical and chemical properties of these exocomets can be probed by the recently introduced curve of growth approach, which enables column densities measurements in exocomets using observations in numerous spectral lines. Using this approach, we present a new study of archival spectra of Beta Pic obtained with the HST, the HARPS spectrograph, and at the Mont John University Observatory, aimed at constraining the abundance of refractory ions in Beta Pic exocomets. 29 individual objects are studied, all observed in FeII lines (used as a reference ion) and at least one other species (Ni II, Ca II, Cr II...). We find that the refractory composition of exocomets is overall stable, especially for singly ionised species, and consistent with solar abundances. This validates the use of the curve of growth approach to study exocometary composition. We also show that some ions, such as Ca II, are significantly depleted compared to solar abundances, allowing us to constrain the ionisation state in Beta Pic exocomets. We find that most refractory elements (Mg, Ni, Fe...) are split in similar fractions between their first and second ionisation states, with the exception of Ca, mostly ionized twice. A strong correlation between the Al III/Fe II ratio and radial velocity is also found, showing that the most redshifted exocomets tend to be more ionised. These results open the way for further modelling, in order to better understand the physical processes that influence the composition and shape of exocometary tails.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14426v2" target="_blank">Quantum States Imaging of Magnetic Field Contours based on Autler-Townes   Effect in Yb Atoms</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanaporn Na Narong, Hongquan Li, Joshua Tong, Mario Dueñas, Leo Hollberg</p>
            <p>An inter-combination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals "dark stripes" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V-system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic fields measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition allows for $\sim\mu$s response time and a large dynamic range (from microtesla to many tesla).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09699v2" target="_blank">Tensor meson transition form factors in holographic QCD and the muon   $g-2$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luigi Cappiello, Josef Leutgeb, Jonas Mager, Anton Rebhan</p>
            <p>Despite the prominence of tensor mesons in photon-photon collisions, until recently their contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLBL) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been estimated at the level of only a few $10^{-12}$, with an almost negligible contribution to the error budget of the Standard Model prediction. A recent reanalysis within the dispersive approach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in previous approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with opposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the transition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in holographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and the observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant $f_2(1270)$, requiring only that the energy-momentum tensor correlator is matched to the leading OPE result of QCD. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark model, the result for $a_\mu$ turns out to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few $10^{-11}$. We discuss both pole and non-pole contributions arising from tensor meson exchanges in the holographic HLBL amplitude, finding that keeping all contributions improves dramatically the convergence of a sum over excited tensor mesons and avoids unnaturally large contributions from the first few excited modes at low energies. Moreover, we find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill the gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLBL amplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Total $a_\mu^\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution: $+12.4\times 10^{-11}$; with an $F_\rho$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\times 10^{-11}$.</p>
