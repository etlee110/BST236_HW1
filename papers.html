            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00152v3" target="_blank">Quantum key distribution rates from non-symmetric conic optimization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrés González Lorente, Pablo V. Parellada, Miguel Castillo-Celeita, Mateus Araújo</p>
            <p>Computing key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD) numerically is essential to unlock more powerful protocols, that use more sophisticated measurement bases or quantum systems of higher dimension. It is a difficult optimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function: the (quantum) relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for a long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a non-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones. Recently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing over non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this algorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient technique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has the advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03739v1" target="_blank">Observables and Unconstrained Spin Tensor Dynamics in General Relativity   from Scattering Amplitudes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Alaverdian, Zvi Bern, Dimitrios Kosmopoulos, Andres Luna, Radu Roiban, Trevor Scheopner, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>In a previous Letter, we showed that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. In this paper, we provide further details on the physics of these additional degrees of freedom, whose commutation relations and Poisson brackets are inherited from the underlying Lorentz symmetry, and on their consequence on observables. In particular, we give the waveform at leading order in Newton's constant and up to second order in the components of the spin tensor, and the conservative impulse, boost and spin kick, exhibiting spin magnitude change, through next-to-leading-order in Newton's constant and third order in the components of the spin tensor. We provide explicit examples -- a Newtonian two-particle bound system and a certain black-hole solution in an exotic matter-coupled gravitational theory -- that exhibit these degrees of freedom and are described by our four-dimensional and worldline field theories. We also discuss connections between these degrees of freedom and dynamical worldline multipole moments. We construct effective two-body Hamiltonians, we demonstrate explicitly that the extra degrees of freedom beyond the spin vector are necessary to describe the complete dynamics, and we explicitly remove certain unphysical singularities. Moreover, we show that the previously proposed eikonal (or radial action) formula correctly captures observables derived from the classical Hamiltonian. Finally, we comment on possible descriptions of the additional degrees of freedom from the perspective of Goldstone's theorem.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17469v2" target="_blank">Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank Noé, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schirò</p>
            <p>Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16142v4" target="_blank">Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on   multiple physical models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trinidad Gatica, Elwin van 't Wout, Reza Haqshenas</p>
            <p>Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03732v1" target="_blank">Can Hyperbolic Diffusion Help Explain Sharp Edges in the Gaps in   Saturn's Rings?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Todd Williams</p>
            <p>We explore whether hyperbolic diffusion may help explain sharp edges in the gaps in Saturn's rings. Sharp edges are conventionally understood to be due to angular momentum flux reversal at gap edges. We do not dispute this finding, but investigate whether non-classical diffusion may amplify this finding. We explore a simple model of hyperbolic diffusion for the radial spread of material in planetary rings. The model arises by the introduction of a relaxation time in an advection equation for the radial diffusive angular momentum flux. We show that radial secular forcing, combined with a hyperbolic diffusion equation, leads to sharp gap edges, in which the density of ring material drops precipitously down to zero at some critical distance from the moon's orbit. Additionally, we show that our simple model can produce large ``spikes'' or ``horns'' in the density profile on either side of a ring gap, mirroring results of large N-body simulations. It remains to be seen how these results may be affected by the inclusion of the well-understood angular momentum flux reversal near tidally-induced gap edges.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03344v2" target="_blank">Surface tension-driven boundary growth in tumour spheroids</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Riccobelli</p>
            <p>Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the spheroid as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress. Our theoretical framework is validated using experimental results from the literature. Like fully developed tumours, spheroids open when subjected to radial cuts. Remarkably, this behaviour is observed even in newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00908v2" target="_blank">Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoit Collins, Razvan Gurau, Luca Lionni</p>
            <p>We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.   The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.   Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.   Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00024v2" target="_blank">Quantum-limited amplification without instability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Metelmann, O. Lanes, T-Z. Chien, A. McDonald, I. Tsiamis, M. Hatridge, A. A. Clerk</p>
            <p>Quantum parametric amplifiers typically generate by operating in proximity to a point of dynamical instability. We consider an alternate general strategy where quantum-limited, large-gain amplification is achieved without any proximity to a dynamical instability. Our basic mechanism (involving dynamics that conserves the number of squeezed photons) enables the design of a variety of one and two mode amplifiers that are not limited by any fundamental gain-bandwidth constraint. We focus on a particular realization that allows us to realize an ideal single-mode squeezing operation in transmission, and which has zero reflection. We present both a thorough theoretical analysis of this system (including pump-depletion effects), and also discuss results of an experimental superconducting quantum circuit implementation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03725v1" target="_blank">Noncommutative Phantom BTZ Black Hole</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Hamil, B. C. Lütfüoğlu</p>
            <p>This work explores the thermodynamic and geometric properties of phantom BTZ black holes within the framework of noncommutative spacetime, where noncommutative effects are incorporated via Lorentzian distributions for mass and charge. The resulting modifications in spacetime geometry introduce significant alterations to horizon structures and curvature singularities. A comprehensive and comparative thermodynamic analysis is conducted, examining the differences between phantom and ordinary matter cases. This includes an investigation of Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and stability criteria. Additionally, the black hole is analyzed as a thermodynamic heat engine, with its efficiency evaluated as a function of noncommutative parameters. Our findings highlight the profound impact of noncommutativity on the thermodynamic behavior and efficiency of phantom BTZ black holes, revealing new insights into the interplay between quantum spacetime effects and exotic field dynamics. The results indicate that noncommutative corrections not only modify the stability conditions of these black holes but also play a crucial role in governing phase transitions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that noncommutativity influences energy extraction processes, refining our understanding of black hole thermodynamics in lower-dimensional spacetimes and distinguishing the behavior of phantom and ordinary matter cases.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05581v2" target="_blank">Optimizing Gate Decomposition for High-Level Quantum Programming</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evandro C. R. Rosa, Eduardo I. Duzzioni, Rafael de Santiago</p>
            <p>This paper presents novel methods for optimizing multi-controlled quantum gates, which naturally arise in high-level quantum programming. Our primary approach involves rewriting $U(2)$ gates as $SU(2)$ gates, utilizing one auxiliary qubit for phase correction. This reduces the number of CNOT gates required to decompose any multi-controlled quantum gate from $O(n^2)$ to at most $32n$. Additionally, we can reduce the number of CNOTs for multi-controlled Pauli gates from $16n$ to $12n$ and propose an optimization to reduce the number of controlled gates in high-level quantum programming. We have implemented these optimizations in the Ket quantum programming platform and demonstrated significant reductions in the number of gates. For instance, for a Grover's algorithm layer with 114 qubits, we achieved a reduction in the number of CNOTs from 101,252 to 2,684. This reduction in the number of gates significantly impacts the execution time of quantum algorithms, thereby enhancing the feasibility of executing them on NISQ computers.</p>
