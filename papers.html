            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19418v1" target="_blank">Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled   quantum systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04257v3" target="_blank">Dilaton-induced variations in Planck constant and speed of light: An   alternative to Dark Energy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Ky Nguyen</p>
            <p>We reveal a novel aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\,$The dynamics of the dilaton can induce variations in the Planck constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. $\,$Our mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes via the dilaton offers a viable alternative account for late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19417v1" target="_blank">Hi Robot: Open-Ended Instruction Following with Hierarchical   Vision-Language-Action Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucy Xiaoyang Shi, Brian Ichter, Michael Equi, Liyiming Ke, Karl Pertsch, Quan Vuong, James Tanner, Anna Walling, Haohuan Wang, Niccolo Fusai, Adrian Li-Bell, Danny Driess, Lachy Groom, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn</p>
            <p>Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19415v1" target="_blank">Seimei KOOLS-IFU mapping of the gas and dust distributions in Galactic   PNe: the origin and evolution of DdDm1</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Otsuka</p>
            <p>We conduct a detailed study of the planetary nebula (PN) DdDm1 in the Galactic halo field. DdDm1 is a metal-deficient and the most carbon-poor PN (C/O = 0.11 +/- 0.02) identified in the Galaxy. We aim to verify whether it evolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin and evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the nebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1 using multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9 arcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact spatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite their similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher condensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains such as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation. Using a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental abundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on our own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas and dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single star with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus, DdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without experiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities in excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB evolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into the internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and highlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19406v1" target="_blank">Single-shot and two-shot decoding with generalized bicycle codes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hsiang-Ku Lin, Xingrui Liu, Pak Kau Lim, Leonid P. Pryadko</p>
            <p>Generalized-bicycle (GB) quantum error-correcting codes have naturally redundant minimum-weight stabilizer generators. To use this redundancy, we constructed several short GB codes with relatively large dimensions, distances, and syndrome distances, also admitting fault-tolerant near-time-optimal syndrome measurement schedules. We simulated their performance both under phenomenological noise and standard circuit noise, using sliding window sequential decoding protocol covering $T\ge 1$ measurement rounds at a time, based on an in-house binary BP+OSD decoder. While true single-shot decoding ($T=1$) may suffer from a significant loss of accuracy, already two-shot ($T=2$) decoding gives nearly the same logical error rates as multi-shot with much larger $T$. Comparison with the same codes but redundant stabilizer generators dropped show significantly improved decoding accuracy for all $T\ge1$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19404v1" target="_blank">Node-to-node contact-friction problems using run-time parameter updates   on a conventional force-deformation finite element</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asifur Rahman, Kevin R. Mackie</p>
            <p>A novel implementation of the traditional node-to-node Coulomb contact-friction problem is presented that utilizes run-time parameter updates on conventional elasto-plastic elements. The two-noded elements are defined by an independent uniaxial force-deformation (or constitutive) relation in each degree of freedom. The location of the two nodes may or may not be coincident. A parameter is a pointer to a value (nodal geometry, element property, material property, etc.) in the finite element domain that can be controlled by the user. Parameters that control the frictional interface normal and tangential responses are updated based on contact detection, and eliminate the need for adding new source code to the finite element library of a given software. The run-time algorithm for updating both an elastic and elasto-plastic force-deformation element to achieve a penalty-based contact-friction model is presented. Static and dynamic cases were investigated for a two-noded unit process and compared with the results obtained from closed-form solutions. Multiple interface elements were then used for the sliding, tipping, and rocking responses of a rigid block on rigid foundation. Finally, several case studies were investigated, and the findings were compared with the experimental results or solutions from the literature. The proposed friction-contact implementation can be deployed in larger finite element models, and parameter updates facilitate implementation of a wider array of friction models by changing only the constitutive model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15697v2" target="_blank">Numerical study of solar eruption, extreme-ultraviolet wave propagation,   and wave-induced prominence dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriia Liakh, Rony Keppens</p>
            <p>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of a horizontal extent of 1100 Mm, while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC 3.1} code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form a flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasi-circular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing the equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors: the fast EUV wave slightly decelerates as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence-hosting flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</p>

            <p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins, materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss other common technical challenges, including explainability, out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17413v3" target="_blank">Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. S. Le, S. W. Hancock, N. Tripathi, H. M. Milchberg</p>
            <p>We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16247v2" target="_blank">A Deep Learning Earth System Model for Efficient Simulation of the   Observed Climate</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathaniel Cresswell-Clay, Bowen Liu, Dale Durran, Zihui Liu, Zachary I. Espinosa, Raul Moreno, Matthias Karlbauer</p>
            <p>A key challenge for computationally intensive state-of-the-art Earth System models is to distinguish global warming signals from interannual variability. Here we introduce DLESyM, a parsimonious deep learning model that accurately simulates the Earth's current climate over 1000-year periods with no smoothing or drift. DLESyM simulations equal or exceed key metrics of seasonal and interannual variability--such as tropical cyclogenesis over the range of observed intensities, the cycle of the Indian Summer monsoon, and the climatology of mid-latitude blocking events--when compared to historical simulations from four leading models from the 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project. DLESyM, trained on both historical reanalysis data and satellite observations, is an accurate, highly efficient model of the coupled Earth system, empowering long-range sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasts while using a fraction of the energy and computational time required by traditional models.</p>
