            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20398v1" target="_blank">A physically motivated galaxy size definition across different   state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Arjona-Galvez, Salvador Cardona-Barrero, Robert J. J. Grand, Arianna Di Cintio, Claudio Dalla Vecchia, Jose A. Benavides, Andrea V. Maccio, Noam Libeskind, Alexander Knebe</p>
            <p>Galaxy sizes are a key parameter to distinguishing between different galaxy types and morphologies, reflecting their formation and assembly histories. Several methods define galaxy boundaries, often relying on light concentration or isophotal densities. However, these approaches were often constrained by observational limitations and did not necessarily provide a clear physical boundary for galaxy outskirts. With modern deep imaging surveys, a new physically motivated definition has emerged using the radial position of the star formation threshold as the galaxy size, approximated by the stellar mass density contour at 1 Msun pc^-2 (R_1). We test this definition using three state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation suites, analyzing stellar surface density profiles across a wide range of stellar masses and redshifts. We measure the galaxy sizes according to this new definition and compare them with the most traditional size metric, the stellar half-mass radius. Our analysis demonstrates that the R_1-M_star relation exhibits consistent behaviour across both low and high-stellar mass galaxies, with remarkably low scatter. This relation is independent of redshift and holds across the three different cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites, highlighting its robustness to variations in galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we explore the connection between a galaxy's total mass within R1 and its stellar mass, finding very little scatter in this relation. This suggests that R1 could serve as a reliable observational tracer for the galaxy's dynamical mass. The size-stellar mass relation proposed provides a reliable and physically motivated method for defining the outskirts of galaxies. This method remains consistent not only at z=0 but also throughout the evolutionary history of galaxies, offering a robust and meaningful framework for galaxy evolution studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Kuzovchikov</p>
            <p>We study the connection between $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ spin chains and one-dimensional sigma models on flag manifolds. Using this connection, we calculate the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and geodesics for a particular class of metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\mathcal{F}_3$, which is a manifold of complete flags in $\mathbb{C}^3$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20394v1" target="_blank">Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization   group study</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Asrap Murshed, Sanjib Kumar Das, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20391v1" target="_blank">Point Policy: Unifying Observations and Actions with Key Points for   Robot Manipulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto</p>
            <p>Building robotic agents capable of operating across diverse environments and object types remains a significant challenge, often requiring extensive data collection. This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos and without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Our experiments on 8 real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 75% absolute improvement over prior works when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, Point Policy exhibits a 74% gain across tasks for novel object instances and is robust to significant background clutter. Videos of the robot are best viewed at https://point-policy.github.io/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20390v1" target="_blank">InterMimic: Towards Universal Whole-Body Control for Physics-Based   Human-Object Interactions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Xu, Hung Yu Ling, Yu-Xiong Wang, Liang-Yan Gui</p>
            <p>Achieving realistic simulations of humans interacting with a wide range of objects has long been a fundamental goal. Extending physics-based motion imitation to complex human-object interactions (HOIs) is challenging due to intricate human-object coupling, variability in object geometries, and artifacts in motion capture data, such as inaccurate contacts and limited hand detail. We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets. The learned policy generalizes in a zero-shot manner and seamlessly integrates with kinematic generators, elevating the framework from mere imitation to generative modeling of complex human-object interactions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20382v1" target="_blank">Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via   Trajectory Optimization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lujie Yang, H. J. Terry Suh, Tong Zhao, Bernhard Paus Graesdal, Tarik Kelestemur, Jiuguang Wang, Tao Pang, Russ Tedrake</p>
            <p>We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input. Project website: https://lujieyang.github.io/physicsgen/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20374v1" target="_blank">Fault-Resilience of Dissipative Processes for Quantum Computing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Purcell, Abhishek Rajput, Toby Cubitt</p>
            <p>Dissipative processes have long been proposed as a means of performing computational tasks on quantum computers that may be intrinsically more robust to noise. In this work, we prove two main results concerning the error-resilience capabilities of two types of dissipative algorithms: dissipative ground state preparation in the form of the dissipative quantum eigensolver (DQE), and dissipative quantum computation (DQC). The first result is that under circuit-level depolarizing noise, a version of the DQE algorithm applied to the geometrically local, stabilizer-encoded Hamiltonians that arise naturally when fermionic Hamiltonians are represented in qubits, can suppress the additive error in the ground space overlap of the final output state exponentially in the code distance. This enables us to get closer to fault-tolerance for this task without the associated overhead. In contrast, for computation as opposed to ground state preparation, the second result proves that DQC is no more robust to noise than the standard quantum circuit model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20373v1" target="_blank">Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lixing Zhang, Ze-Xun Lin, Prineha Narang, Di Luo</p>
            <p>Hybrid quantum systems are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per measurement.To validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12255v2" target="_blank">Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz, Yuan Xin</p>
            <p>We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16032v4" target="_blank">Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems   away from the charge-neutrality point</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>
