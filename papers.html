            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05699v1" target="_blank">Fast and memory efficient strong simulation of noisy adaptive linear   optical circuits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothée Goubault de Brugière, Nicolas Heurtel</p>
            <p>Exactly computing the full output distribution of linear optical circuits remains a challenge, as existing methods are either time-efficient but memory-intensive or memory-efficient but slow. Moreover, any realistic simulation must account for noise, and any viable quantum computing scheme based on linear optics requires feedforward. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that models the output amplitudes as partial derivatives of a multivariate polynomial. The algorithm explores the lattice of all intermediate partial derivatives, where each derivative is used to compute more efficiently ones with higher degree. In terms of memory, storing one path from the root to the leaves is sufficient to iterate over all amplitudes and requires only $2^n$ elements, as opposed to $\binom{n+m-1}{n}$ for the fastest state of the art method. This approach effectively balances the time-memory trade-off while extending to both noisy and feedforward scenarios with negligible cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in the literature to meet all these requirements. We demonstrate how this method enables the simulation of systems that were previously out of reach, while providing a concrete implementation and complexity analysis.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05698v1" target="_blank">Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathon Riddell, Katja Klobas, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05697v1" target="_blank">How pairing mechanism dictates topology in valley-polarized   superconductors with Berry curvature</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian May-Mann, Tobias Helbig, Trithep Devakul</p>
            <p>We investigate how the pairing mechanism influences topological superconductivity in valley-polarized systems with Berry curvature. We demonstrate that short-range attractive interactions, such as those mediated by phonons, favor superconducting states where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Chern number has the same sign as the Berry curvature. In contrast, overscreened repulsive interactions, as in the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, favor superconducting states where the BdG Chern number has the opposite sign as the Berry curvature. We establish these trends in a fully controlled limit and apply them to a recently reported chiral superconductor in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Our theory provides a concrete experimental criterion for distinguishing between different pairing mechanisms in valley-polarized topological superconductors.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05694v1" target="_blank">The discovery and characterization of Earth-crossing asteroid 2024   YR$_4$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryce T. Bolin, Josef Hanuš, Larry Denneau, Roberto Bonamico, Laura-May Abron, Marco Delbo, Josef Ďurech, Robert Jedicke, Leo Y. Alcorn, Aleksandar Cikota, Swayamtrupta Panda, Henrique Reggiani</p>
            <p>We describe observations and physical characteristics of Earth-crossing asteroid 2024 YR$_4$, discovered on 2024 December 27 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The asteroid has semi-major axis, $a$ = 2.52 au, eccentricity, $e$ = 0.66, inclination $i$ = 3.41$^{\circ}$, and a $\sim$0.003 au Earth minimum orbit intersection distance. We obtained g, r, i, and Z imaging with the Gemini South/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on 2025 February 7. We measured a g-i spectral slope of 13$\pm$3 $\%$/100 nm, and color indices g-r = 0.70$\pm$0.10, r-i = 0.25$\pm$0.06, i-Z = -0.27$\pm$0.10. 2024 YR$_4$ has a spectrum that best matches R-type and Sa-type asteroids and a diameter of $\sim$30-65 m using our measured absolute magnitude of 23.9$\pm$0.3, and assuming an albedo of 0.15-0.4. The lightcurve of 2024 YR$_4$ shows $\sim$0.4 mag variations with a rotation period of $\sim$1170 s. We use photometry of 2024 YR$_4$ from Gemini and other sources taken between 2024 December to 2025 February to determine the asteroid's spin vector and shape, finding that it has an oblate, $\sim$3:1 a:c axial ratio and a pole direction of $\lambda$, $\beta$ = $\sim$42$^{\circ}$, $\sim$-25$^{\circ}$. Finally, we compare the orbital elements of 2024 YR$_4$ with the NEO population model and find that its most likely sources are resonances between the inner and central Main Belt.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05693v1" target="_blank">Dynamics of disordered quantum systems with two- and three-dimensional   tensor networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Tindall, Antonio Mello, Matt Fishman, Miles Stoudenmire, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [arXiv:2403.00910] and, following extensive comparison to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. The scalability of our simulations allows us to verify the universal physics present in the system and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05691v1" target="_blank">Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic   Microwave Background</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itamar J. Allali, Praniti Singh, JiJi Fan, Lingfeng Li</p>
            <p>Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell <30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05690v1" target="_blank">Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franco Vargas Pallete, Yilin Wang, Catherine Wolfram</p>
            <p>Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism with (1) the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle. From these geometric interpretations, we obtain two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms, one from the isoperimetric inequality and the other from the monotonicity of the Loewner energy. Moreover, we show that the horocycle truncation used in Epstein's construction of the Epstein curve also defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05687v1" target="_blank">Quantum gas microscopy of three-flavor Hubbard systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jirayu Mongkolkiattichai, Liyu Liu, Sohail Dasgupta, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Peter Schauss</p>
            <p>Hubbard systems are paradigmatic realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems. Introducing additional species breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model and leads to a wide variety of novel exotic quantum phases. Three-component fermionic systems are at the heart of model systems for quantum chromodynamics where the three components reflect the three flavors. Here, we extend quantum gas microscopy to three-flavor Fermi lattice gases in the Hubbard regime. Relying on site- and flavor-resolved detection, we study the phase diagram of the three-flavor Hubbard model and find signatures of flavor-selective localization and selective pairing at temperatures down to the tunneling energy scale. Our measurements are compared with numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further increase of phase space density may enable the observation of a novel pair Mott phase at half filling, and shows a path towards the study of color superfluidity and other aspects of quantum chromodynamics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05681v1" target="_blank">Defining Determinism</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hans Halvorson, JB Manchak, James Owen Weatherall</p>
            <p>Determinism is the thesis that the past determines the future, but efforts to define it precisely have exposed deep methodological disagreements. Standard possible-worlds formulations of determinism presuppose an "agreement" relation between worlds, but this relation can be understood in multiple ways -- none of which is particularly clear. We critically examine the proliferation of definitions of determinism in the recent literature, arguing that these definitions fail to deliver clear verdicts about actual scientific theories. We advocate a return to a formal approach, in the logical tradition of Carnap, that treats determinism as a property of scientific theories, rather than an elusive metaphysical doctrine.   We highlight two key distinctions: (1) the difference between qualitative and "full" determinism, as emphasized in recent discussions of physics and metaphysics, and (2) the distinction between weak and strong formal conditions on the uniqueness of world extensions. We argue that defining determinism in terms of metaphysical notions such as haecceities is unhelpful, whereas rigorous formal criteria -- such as Belot's D1 and D3 -- offer a tractable and scientifically relevant account. By clarifying what it means for a theory to be deterministic, we set the stage for a fruitful interaction between physics and metaphysics.</p>

            <p>Electron-capture decays of $^{125}$Xe and $^{127}$Xe, and double-electron-capture decays of $^{124}$Xe, are backgrounds in searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) conducted by dual-phase xenon time projection chambers such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ). These decays produce signals with more light and less charge than equivalent-energy $\beta$ decays, and correspondingly overlap more with WIMP signals. We measure three electron-capture charge yields in LZ: the 1.1~keV M-shell, 5.2~keV L-shell, and 33.2~keV K-shell at drift fields of 193~V/cm and 96.5~V/cm. The LL double-electron-capture decay of $^{124}$Xe exhibits even more pronounced shifts in charge and light. We provide a first model of double-electron-capture charge yields using the link between ionization density and electron-ion recombination, and identify a need for more accurate calculations. Finally, we discuss the implications of the reduced charge yield of these decays and other interactions creating inner-shell vacancies for future dark matter searches.</p>
