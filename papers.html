            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15678v1" target="_blank">Testing the limits of fine-tuning to improve reasoning in vision   language models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca M. Schulze Buschoff, Konstantinos Voudouris, Elif Akata, Matthias Bethge, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Eric Schulz</p>
            <p>Pre-trained vision language models still fall short of human visual cognition. In an effort to improve visual cognition and align models with human behavior, we introduce visual stimuli and human judgments on visual cognition tasks, allowing us to systematically evaluate performance across cognitive domains under a consistent environment. We fine-tune models on ground truth data for intuitive physics and causal reasoning and find that this improves model performance in the respective fine-tuning domain. Furthermore, it can improve model alignment with human behavior. However, we find that fine-tuning does not contribute to robust human-like generalization to data with other visual characteristics or to tasks in other cognitive domains.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15668v1" target="_blank">Controlling curvature of self-assembling surfaces via patchy particle   design</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andraž Gnidovec, Simon Čopar</p>
            <p>Curved structures in soft matter and biological systems commonly emerge as a result of self-assembly processes where building blocks aggregate in a controlled manner, giving rise to specific system structure and properties. Learning how to precisely tune the curved geometry of these assemblies can in turn elucidate new ways of controlling their functionality. We discuss how one can target self-assembly into surfaces with specified Gaussian curvature in a one-component system of model patchy particles. Given the vast design space of potential patch distributions, we address the problem using an inverse design approach based on automatic differentiation and develop an optimization scheme which solves the exploding gradients problem that arises when we differentiate through long molecular dynamics trajectories. We discuss the model requirements for successful optimization, determine the significant hyperparameter choices influencing algorithm performance and, finally, we demonstrate that we can consistently design patch patterns for assembly into clusters with different target curvature radii.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12110v2" target="_blank">Coherent optical two-photon resonance tomographic imaging in three   dimensions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Mazelanik, Adam Leszczyński, Tomasz Szawełło, Michał Parniak</p>
            <p>Magnetic resonance imaging is a three-dimensional imaging technique, where a gradient of the magnetic field is used to interrogate spin resonances with spatial resolution. The application of this technique to probe the coherence of atoms with good three-dimensional resolution is a challenging application. We propose and demonstrate an optical method to probe spin resonances via a two-photon Raman transition, reconstructing the 3D-structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence, which is itself subject to external fields. Our method relies on a single time-and-space resolved heterodyne measurement, allowing the reconstruction of a complex 3D coherence profile. Owing to the optical interface, we reach a tomographic image resolution of $14\times14\times36$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^3$. The technique allows to probe any transparent medium with a resonance structure and provides a robust diagnostic tool for atom-based quantum information protocols. As such, it is a viable technique for application to magnetometry, electrometry, and imaging of electromagnetic fields.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19416v2" target="_blank">Lightweight Thermal Management Strategies for the Silicon Detectors of   CBM at FAIR</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Franz Matejcek, Kshitij Agarwal, CBM Collaboration</p>
            <p>Lightweight thermal management is central to the design of the all-silicon Inner Tracker of the Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). This experiment aims to study strongly interacting matter at neutron star core densities through fixed-target Au-Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9$\,GeV; up to 10$^7$ beam-target interactions per second; polar angular acceptance of $2.5^{\circ} \leq \Theta \leq 25^{\circ}$). Studies with thermal demonstrators for both the pixel-based Micro Vertex Detector and the strip-based Silicon Tracking System have validated their thermal management strategies, preparing them for series production now and global commissioning in 2028.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00116v2" target="_blank">Bayesian Calibration for Prediction in a Multi-Output Transposition   Context</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charlie Sire, Josselin Garnier, Cédric Durantin, Baptiste Kerleguer, Gilles Defaux, Guillaume Perrin</p>
            <p>Numerical simulations are widely used to predict the behavior of physical systems, with Bayesian approaches being particularly well suited for this purpose. However, experimental observations are necessary to calibrate certain simulator parameters for the prediction. In this work, we use a multi-output simulator to predict all its outputs, including those that have never been experimentally observed. This situation is referred to as the transposition context. To accurately quantify the discrepancy between model outputs and real data in this context, conventional methods cannot be applied, and the Bayesian calibration must be augmented by incorporating a joint model error across all outputs.To achieve this, the proposed method is to consider additional numerical input parameters within a hierarchical Bayesian model, which includes hyperparameters for the prior distribution of the calibration variables. This approach is applied on a computer code with three outputs that models the Taylor cylinder impact test with a small number of observations. The outputs are considered as the observed variables one at a time, to work with three different transposition situations. The proposed method is compared with other approaches that embed model errors to demonstrate the significance of the hierarchical formulation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15659v1" target="_blank">Efficient approximation of regularized relative entropies and   applications</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Fang, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi</p>
            <p>The quantum relative entropy is a fundamental quantity in quantum information science, characterizing the distinguishability between two quantum states. However, this quantity is not additive in general for correlated quantum states, necessitating regularization for precise characterization of the operational tasks of interest. Recently, we proposed the study of the regularized relative entropy between two sequences of sets of quantum states in [arXiv:2411.04035], which captures a general framework for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we show that given suitable structural assumptions and efficient descriptions of the sets, the regularized relative entropy can be efficiently approximated within an additive error by a quantum relative entropy program of polynomial size. This applies in particular to the regularized relative entropy in adversarial quantum channel discrimination. Moreover, we apply the idea of efficient approximation to quantum resource theories. In particular, when the set of interest does not directly satisfy the required structural assumptions, it can be relaxed to one that does. This provides improved and efficient bounds for the entanglement cost of quantum states and channels, entanglement distillation and magic state distillation. Numerical results demonstrate improvements even for the first level of approximation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11431v2" target="_blank">Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary   temperatures</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Kimura, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15651v1" target="_blank">Overview of the data acquisition system architecture for the   DarkSide-20k experiment</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Adriana Sabia</p>
            <p>The DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) detector is designed to directly search for dark matter by detecting weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scattering off nuclei in a 20 tonnes target of low radioactivity Argon from underground sources, in a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The scintillation light produced by these interactions is recorded by custom silicon photomultiplier (SiPMs) assemblies comprising the detector's 2720 readout channels. The data acquisition system (DAQ) for the DS-20k experiment operates in a triggerless mode, handling the estimated 3 GB/s flow of digitized data from MC simulation from the entire detector, dominated by the TPC. Signals are digitized by 48 commercial VX2745 CAEN 16-bit, 125 MS/s, high channel density waveform digitizers. This digitized data is then transferred to 24 Front-End Processor (FEP) machines for an initial data reduction stage. Subsequently, the processed data is sent to a separate set of Time Slice Processor (TSP) computers, where it is assembled into fixed-length time series for further analysis and storage for offline processing.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15649v1" target="_blank">A Simulation Pipeline to Facilitate Real-World Robotic Reinforcement   Learning Applications</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefferson Silveira, Joshua A. Marshall, Sidney N. Givigi Jr</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction for its success in solving complex tasks for robotic applications. However, its deployment on physical robots remains challenging due to safety risks and the comparatively high costs of training. To avoid these problems, RL agents are often trained on simulators, which introduces a new problem related to the gap between simulation and reality. This paper presents an RL pipeline designed to help reduce the reality gap and facilitate developing and deploying RL policies for real-world robotic systems. The pipeline organizes the RL training process into an initial step for system identification and three training stages: core simulation training, high-fidelity simulation, and real-world deployment, each adding levels of realism to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Each training stage takes an input policy, improves it, and either passes the improved policy to the next stage or loops it back for further improvement. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves the desired performance. The pipeline's effectiveness is shown through a case study with the Boston Dynamics Spot mobile robot used in a surveillance application. The case study presents the steps taken at each pipeline stage to obtain an RL agent to control the robot's position and orientation.</p>
