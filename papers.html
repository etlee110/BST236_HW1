            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16074v1" target="_blank">PHYBench: Holistic Evaluation of Physical Perception and Reasoning in   Large Language Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Qiu, Shaoyang Guo, Zhuo-Yang Song, Yunbo Sun, Zeyu Cai, Jiashen Wei, Tianyu Luo, Yixuan Yin, Haoxu Zhang, Yi Hu, Chenyang Wang, Chencheng Tang, Haoling Chang, Qi Liu, Ziheng Zhou, Tianyu Zhang, Jingtian Zhang, Zhangyi Liu, Minghao Li, Yuku Zhang, Boxuan Jing, Xianqi Yin, Yutong Ren, Zizhuo Fu, Weike Wang, Xudong Tian, Anqi Lv, Laifu Man, Jianxiang Li, Feiyu Tao, Qihua Sun, Zhou Liang, Yushu Mu, Zhongxuan Li, Jing-Jun Zhang, Shutao Zhang, Xiaotian Li, Xingqi Xia, Jiawei Lin, Zheyu Shen, Jiahang Chen, Qiuhao Xiong, Binran Wang, Fengyuan Wang, Ziyang Ni, Bohan Zhang, Fan Cui, Changkun Shao, Qing-Hong Cao, Ming-xing Luo, Muhan Zhang, Hua Xing Zhu</p>
            <p>We introduce PHYBench, a novel, high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in physical contexts. PHYBench consists of 500 meticulously curated physics problems based on real-world physical scenarios, designed to assess the ability of models to understand and reason about realistic physical processes. Covering mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, and advanced physics, the benchmark spans difficulty levels from high school exercises to undergraduate problems and Physics Olympiad challenges. Additionally, we propose the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score, a novel evaluation metric based on the edit distance between mathematical expressions, which effectively captures differences in model reasoning processes and results beyond traditional binary scoring methods. We evaluate various LLMs on PHYBench and compare their performance with human experts. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, highlighting their limitations and the need for improvement in complex physical reasoning scenarios. Our benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://phybench-official.github.io/phybench-demo/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18902v2" target="_blank">Capacity threshold for the Ising perceptron</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brice Huang</p>
            <p>We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_*(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07863v2" target="_blank">Interlacing triangles, Schubert puzzles, and graph colorings</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Gaetz, Yibo Gao</p>
            <p>We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16069v1" target="_blank">Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation & Einstein-Cartan   gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minxi He, Muzi Hong, Kyohei Mukaida</p>
            <p>We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16068v1" target="_blank">High-performance training and inference for deep equivariant interatomic   potentials</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuin Wei Tan, Marc L. Descoteaux, Mit Kotak, Gabriel de Miranda Nascimento, Se√°n R. Kavanagh, Laura Zichi, Menghang Wang, Aadit Saluja, Yizhong R. Hu, Tess Smidt, Anders Johansson, William C. Witt, Boris Kozinsky, Albert Musaelian</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials, particularly those based on deep equivariant neural networks, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and computational efficiency in atomistic modeling tasks like molecular dynamics and high-throughput screening. The size of datasets and demands of downstream workflows are growing rapidly, making robust and scalable software essential. This work presents a major overhaul of the NequIP framework focusing on multi-node parallelism, computational performance, and extensibility. The redesigned framework supports distributed training on large datasets and removes barriers preventing full utilization of the PyTorch 2.0 compiler at train time. We demonstrate this acceleration in a case study by training Allegro models on the SPICE 2 dataset of organic molecular systems. For inference, we introduce the first end-to-end infrastructure that uses the PyTorch Ahead-of-Time Inductor compiler for machine learning interatomic potentials. Additionally, we implement a custom kernel for the Allegro model's most expensive operation, the tensor product. Together, these advancements speed up molecular dynamics calculations on system sizes of practical relevance by up to a factor of 18.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16067v1" target="_blank">Two-step laser resonant ionization spectroscopy of chromium</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romina Schulz, Ruohong Li, Julius Wessolek, Maryam Mostamand, Peter Kunz, Jens Lassen</p>
            <p>At TRIUMF's off-line laser ion source test stand, stepwise resonant laser ionization spectroscopy of chromium (Cr) was carried out, to find an efficient ionization scheme suitable for titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser systems. With three different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and 360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a frequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as well as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the ionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as 54575.49(2)$_\text{stat}$(2)$_\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in NIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with 357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently deployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision mass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at TRIUMF-ISAC.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16066v1" target="_blank">Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in   lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kejie Fang, Elizabeth A. Goldschmidt</p>
            <p>Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03040v2" target="_blank">A method for site-specifically tethering the enzyme urease to DNA   origami with sustained activity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Murphy, Keren Bobilev, Daichi Hayakawa, Eden Ikonen, Thomas E. Videb√¶k, Shibani Dalal, Wylie W. Ahmed, Jennifer L. Ross, W. Benjamin Rogers</p>
            <p>Attaching enzymes to nanostructures has proven useful to the study of enzyme functionality under controlled conditions and has led to new technologies. Often, the utility and interest of enzyme-tethered nanostructures lie in how the enzymatic activity is affected by how the enzymes are arranged in space. Therefore, being able to conjugate enzymes to nanostructures while preserving the enzymatic activity is essential. In this paper, we present a method to conjugate single-stranded DNA to the enzyme urease while maintaining enzymatic activity. We show evidence of successful conjugation and quantify the variables that affect the conjugation yield. We also show that the enzymatic activity is unchanged after conjugation compared to the enzyme in its native state. Finally, we demonstrate the tethering of urease to nanostructures made using DNA origami with high site-specificity. Decorating nanostructures with enzymatically-active urease may prove to be useful in studying, or even utilizing, the functionality of urease in disciplines ranging from biotechnology to soft-matter physics. The techniques we present in this paper will enable researchers across these fields to modify enzymes without disrupting their functionality, thus allowing for more insightful studies into their behavior and utility.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16059v1" target="_blank">Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to   Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debottam Nandi, Rohan Roy, Simran Yadav, Arnab Sarkar</p>
            <p>The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16054v1" target="_blank">$œÄ_{0.5}$: a Vision-Language-Action Model with Open-World   Generalization</a></h3>

            <p>In order for robots to be useful, they must perform practically relevant tasks in the real world, outside of the lab. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$\ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.</p>
