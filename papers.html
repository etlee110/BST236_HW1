            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ping Lin</p>
            <p>We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09597v1" target="_blank">Universal Properties of Critical Mixed States from Measurement and   Feedback</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhehao Zhang, Yijian Zou, Timothy H. Hsieh, Sagar Vijay</p>
            <p>We explore the universal properties of mixed quantum matter obtained from "single-shot" adaptive evolution, in which a quantum-critical ground-state is manipulated through a single round of local measurements and local unitary operations conditioned on spatially-distant measurement outcomes. The resulting mixed quantum states are characterized by altered long-distance correlations between local observables, mixed-state entropy, and entanglement negativity. By invoking a coarse-grained, continuum description of single-shot adaptation in (1+1) dimensions, we find that the extensive mixed-state entropy exhibits a sub-leading, constant correction ($\gamma$), while the entanglement negativity can grow logarithmically with sub-region size, with a coefficient ($\alpha$); both constants can attain universal values which are distinct from the expected behavior in any quantum-critical ground-state. We investigate these properties in single-shot adaptation on ($i$) the critical point between a one-dimensional $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and a symmetry-broken state, and ($ii$) a spinful Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. In the former case, adaptive evolution that decoheres one sublattice of the SPT can yield a critical mixed-state in which $\alpha$ attains a universal value, which is half of that in the original state. In the latter case, we show how adaptation -- involving feedback on the spin degrees of freedom, after measuring the local charge -- modifies long-distance correlations, and determine via an exact replica field-theoretic calculation that $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ vary continuously with the strength of feedback. Numerical studies confirm these results.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09596v1" target="_blank">Localisation of hexagonal boron nitride colour centres using patterned   dielectric layers on graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. K. Prasad, V. Babenko, A. W. Tadbier, S. Hofmann, J. P. Goss, J. D. Mar</p>
            <p>One of the most promising building blocks for the development of spin qubits, single-photon sources, and quantum sensors at room temperature, as well as 2D ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, are defect colour centres in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, a significant requirement for the realisation of such devices towards scalable technologies is the deterministic localisation of hBN colour centres. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to the localisation of hBN colour centre emission by using patterned dielectric layers grown on graphene via atomic layer deposition (ALD). While colour centre emission is quenched within areas where hBN is deposited directly on graphene due to charge transfer, it is maintained where hBN is deposited on micron-sized Al2O3 pillars which act as barriers to charge transfer. Importantly, our approach allows for device architectures where graphene layers are used as top and bottom electrodes for the application of vertical electric fields, such as for carrier injection in electroluminescent devices, Stark shifting of colour centre emission, and charge state control of defect colour centres. Furthermore, the use of ALD to grow dielectric layers directly on graphene allows for the control of tunnel barrier thicknesses with atomic layer precision, which is crucial for many of these device applications. Our work represents an important step towards the realisation of a wide range of scalable device applications based on the determinsitic localisation of electrically controlled hBN colour centres</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05262v4" target="_blank">New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an   alternative to dark energy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Ky Nguyen</p>
            <p>In A&A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09595v1" target="_blank">PISA Experiments: Exploring Physics Post-Training for Video Diffusion   Models by Watching Stuff Drop</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyu Li, Oscar Michel, Xichen Pan, Sainan Liu, Mike Roberts, Saining Xie</p>
            <p>Large-scale pre-trained video generation models excel in content creation but are not reliable as physically accurate world simulators out of the box. This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09593v1" target="_blank">A Monte Carlo approach for finding optimally controlled quantum gates   with differential geometry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adonai Hil√°rio da Silva, Leonardo Kleber Castelano, Reginaldo de Jesus Napolitano</p>
            <p>A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09592v1" target="_blank">Parsing the Language of Expression: Enhancing Symbolic Regression with   Domain-Aware Symbolic Priors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sikai Huang, Yixin Berry Wen, Tara Adusumilli, Kusum Choudhary, Haizhao Yang</p>
            <p>Symbolic regression is essential for deriving interpretable expressions that elucidate complex phenomena by exposing the underlying mathematical and physical relationships in data. In this paper, we present an advanced symbolic regression method that integrates symbol priors from diverse scientific domains - including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering - into the regression process. By systematically analyzing domain-specific expressions, we derive probability distributions of symbols to guide expression generation. We propose novel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverage these symbol priors, enabling domain knowledge to steer the learning process. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical tree structure for representing expressions, where unary and binary operators are organized to facilitate more efficient learning. To further accelerate training, we compile characteristic expression blocks from each domain and include them in the operator dictionary, providing relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging symbol priors significantly enhances the performance of symbolic regression, resulting in faster convergence and higher accuracy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00896v2" target="_blank">Cylindrical black hole solutions in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and   $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},A^{ŒºŒΩ}A_{ŒºŒΩ})$ modified gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faizuddin Ahmed, Abdelmalek Bouzenada</p>
            <p>We explore a cylindrical black hole (BH) space-time introduced by Lemos, in the context of modified gravity theories. Specifically, we focus on $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity framework, where we choose two form functions, $f(\mathcal{R})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\,\mathcal{R}^2+\alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+\alpha_3\,\mathcal{R}^4+\alpha_4\,\mathcal{R}^5)$ and $f(\mathcal{R})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha_k\,\mathcal{R}^{k+1},\quad (k=1,2,...n)$. We solve the modified field equations incorporating zero energy-momentum tensor, $\mathcal{T}^{\mu\nu}=0$ and obtain the result. Moreover, we study another well-known modified gravity theory called Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity and investigate this Lemos black hole (LBH) space-time. To achieve this, we consider different classes of models defined as follows: (i) Class-\textbf{I} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A})=(\mathcal{R}+\beta\,\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-\textbf{II} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, and (iii) Class-\textbf{III} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\,\mathcal{R}^2+\alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+\beta_1\,\mathcal{A}+\beta_2\,\mathcal{A}^2+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, where $\mathcal{A}=g_{\mu\nu}\,A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature scalar, $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$. We solve the modified field equations under the same aforementioned scenario of energy-momentum tensor, and obtain the result. Subsequently, we study the geodesic motions of test particles around this LBH within the Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity theories and analyze the outcomes. We demonstrate that different coupling constants chosen in these modified gravity theories influences the usual cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and thus, shifted the result in comparison to the general relativity case.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02583v3" target="_blank">A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton   coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoang Ky Nguyen</p>
            <p>We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09578v1" target="_blank">Long-Time Limits of Local Operator Entanglement in Interacting   Integrable Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Alexander Jacoby, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>We explore the long-time behavior of Local Operator Entanglement entropy (LOE) in finite-size interacting integrable systems. For certain operators in the Rule 54 automaton, we prove that the LOE saturates to a value that is at most logarithmic in system size. The logarithmic bound relies on a feature of Rule 54 that does not generalize to other interacting integrable systems: namely, that there are only two types of quasiparticles, and therefore only two possible values of the phase shift between quasiparticles. We present a heuristic argument, supported by numerical evidence, that for generic interacting integrable systems (such as the Heisenberg spin chain) the saturated value of the LOE is volume-law in system size.</p>
