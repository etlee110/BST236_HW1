            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14867v1" target="_blank">Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body   System</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianyi Chen, Songtao Huang, Yunpeng Ji, Grant L. Schumacher, Alan Tsidilkovski, Alexander Schuckert, Gabriel G. T. Assumpção, Nir Navon</p>
            <p>Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14861v1" target="_blank">Stacking-dependent topological electronic structures in honeycomb-kagome   heterolayers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chan Bin Bark, Hanbyul Kim, Seik Pak, Hong-Guk Min, Sungkyun Ahn, Youngkuk Kim, Moon Jip Park</p>
            <p>Heterostructures of stacked two-dimensional lattices have shown great promise for engineering novel material properties. As an archetypal example of such a system, the hexagon-shared honeycomb-kagome lattice has been experimentally synthesized in various material platforms. In this work, we explore three rotationally symmetric variants of the honeycomb-kagome lattice: the hexagonal, triagonal, and biaxial phases. While the triagonal and biaxial phases exhibit trivial insulating and Dirac semimetal band structures, respectively, the hexagonal phase hosts a higher-order topological phase driven by band inversion near the $\Gamma$-point. This highlights a key distinction from the conventional band inversions at the $K$-point observed in hexagonal homobilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the distinct topological properties of these phases result in network band structures within moir\'e heterostructures formed by twisted or lattice-mismatched HK systems. These network band structures can be experimentally observed through extrinsic twisting or intrinsic lattice mismatching between the honeycomb and kagome systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14859v1" target="_blank">Taming Recoil Effect in Cavity-Assisted Quantum Interconnects</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seigo Kikura, Ryotaro Inoue, Hayata Yamasaki, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami</p>
            <p>Photon recoil is one of the fundamental limitations for high-fidelity control of trapped-atom qubits such as neutral atoms and trapped ions. In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1\% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14850v1" target="_blank">Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shingo Akama</p>
            <p>Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. In this paper, we compute full bispectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated during a contracting phase in a general bounce model. The general bounce model consists of two branches: one realizes scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes become constant on superhorizon scales, as in de Sitter inflation, while the other realizes scale-invariant power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes grow on superhorizon scales, as in matter bounce cosmology. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in these two branches. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of non-Gaussianities and find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. In particular, one of the branches in which the superhorizon perturbations are conserved reproduces the so-called Maldacena's consistency relation. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14849v1" target="_blank">Spatial and Temporal Periodic Density Patterns in Driven Bose-Einstein   Condensates</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. del Río-Lima, J. A. Seman, R. Jáuregui, F. J. Poveda-Cuevas</p>
            <p>The study of collective excitations is a crucial tool for understanding many-body quantum systems. For instance, they play a central role in the exploration of superfluidity and other quantum macroscopic phenomena in Bose and Fermi systems. In this work we present a variational and a numerical study of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical harmonic trap in which the aspect ratio can be varied from a prolate (cigar-shaped) to an oblate (pancake-shaped) system. The excitation can be applied by periodically modulating the harmonic frequencies of the trap or, alternatively, the interatomic interaction strength at a frequency that matches that of the system breathing mode. As a result, we observe the formation of dynamical density patterns that depend on the geometry of the trap: a fringe pattern in a prolate system and a ring pattern in an oblate one. By decomposing the total energy into its kinetic, potential, and interaction terms, we show that the onset of these patterns coincides with the redistribution of kinetic energy along the weakly trapped directions of the sample, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the studied phenomena. Finally, our analysis shows that the difference between the two excitation mechanisms lies on the system stability. Modulating the trap destabilizes the system quicker than modulating the interactions, leading to earlier formation of the patterns.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14845v1" target="_blank">Update on the isospin breaking corrections to the HVP with C-periodic   boundary conditions</a></h3>

            <p>In the RC$^\star$ collaboration, we simulate lattice QCD+QED using $C-$periodic spatial boundary conditions to ensure that locality, gauge invariance, and translational invariance are preserved throughout the calculation. We present our progress in computing isospin-breaking (IB) corrections to the leading hadronic contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. We compare two ways of including the IB corrections: the RM123 method and dynamical QCD+QED simulations, both with $C-$periodic boundary conditions. The two calculations are performed at $\beta=3.24$ with four flavours of $\mathcal{O}(a)-$improved Wilson fermions; the QCD ensemble features $SU(3)-$symmetric sea quarks plus charm, while down and strange quarks are degenerate in QCD+QED gauge ensembles.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14155v3" target="_blank">A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel H. S. Aguiar, George E. A. Matsas</p>
            <p>One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14843v1" target="_blank">Slave-spin approach to the Anderson-Josephson quantum dot</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andriani Keliri, Marco Schirò</p>
            <p>We study a strongly interacting quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads using a slave-spin representation of the dot. At the mean-field level the problem maps into a resonant level model with superconducting leads, coupled to an auxiliary spin-1/2 variable accounting for the parity of the dot. We obtain the mean-field phase diagram, showing a transition between a Kondo (singlet) and a local moment (doublet) regime, corresponding to the $0-\pi$ transition of the junction. The mean-field theory qualitatively captures the Kondo singlet phase and its competition with superconductivity for weak values of the BCS gap, including the non-trivial dependence of the Andreev bound states on the interaction, but fails in the doublet regime where it predicts a dot decoupled from the bath. Using diagrammatic techniques and a random phase approximation, we include fluctuations on top of the mean-field theory to describe finite-frequency dynamics of the effective spin variable. This leads to the formation of high-energy Hubbard bands in the spectral function and a coherent Kondo peak with a BCS gap at low energies. Finally, we compute the Josephson current and the induced superconducting correlations on the dot.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14836v1" target="_blank">Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress   and Challenges</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. -Thomas Janka</p>
            <p>Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14835v1" target="_blank">Adaptive Syndrome Extraction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Berthusen, Shi Jie Samuel Tan, Eric Huang, Daniel Gottesman</p>
            <p>Device error rates on current quantum computers have improved enough to where demonstrations of error correction below break-even are now possible. Still, the circuits required for quantum error correction introduce significant overhead and sometimes inject more errors than they correct. In this work, we introduce adaptive syndrome extraction as a scheme to improve code performance and reduce the quantum error correction cycle time by measuring only the stabilizer generators that are likely to provide useful syndrome information. We provide a concrete example of the scheme through the [[4,2,2]] code concatenated with a hypergraph product code and a syndrome extraction cycle that uses quantum error detection to modify the syndrome extraction circuits in real time. Compared to non-concatenated codes and non-adaptive syndrome extraction, we find that the adaptive scheme achieves over an order of magnitude lower logical error rates while requiring fewer CNOT gates and physical qubits. Furthermore, we show how to achieve fault-tolerant universal logical computation with [[4,2,2]]-concatenated hypergraph product codes.</p>
