            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09613v1" target="_blank">Quantifying complexity of continuous-variable quantum states via Wehrl   entropy and Fisher information</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siting Tang, Francesco Albarelli, Yue Zhang, Shunlong Luo, Matteo G. A. Paris</p>
            <p>The notion of complexity of quantum states is quite different from uncertainty or information contents, and involves the tradeoff between its classical and quantum features. In this work, we we introduce a quantifier of complexity of continuous-variable states, e.g. quantum optical states, based on the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. This quantity is built upon two functions of the state: the Wehrl entropy, capturing the spread of the distribution, and the Fisher information with respect to location parameters, which captures the opposite behaviour, i.e. localization in phase space. We analyze the basic properties of the quantifier and illustrate its features by evaluating complexity of Gaussian states and some relevant non-Gaussian states. We further generalize the quantifier in terms of s-ordered phase-space distributions and illustrate its implications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09611v1" target="_blank">Exchange-driven giant magnetoelastic coupling in Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolina A. Marques, Luke C. Rhodes, Weronika Osmolska, Harry Lane, Izidor Benedičič, Masahiro Naritsuka, Rosalba Fittipaldi, Mariateresa Lettieri, Antonio Vecchione, Peter Wahl</p>
            <p>The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is at the heart of some of the most astonishing phenomena found in condensed matter physics, for example, the condensation of electron pairs into a macroscopically coherent ground state in superconductors. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom resulting in magnetoelastic coupling - an effect that is typically small and only detectable on macroscopic samples. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish control of the magnetism in the surface layer and use this control to probe the impact of the magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, exhibiting a giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, reveal how electronic correlations result in strong electron-lattice coupling and establish Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ as a system to study magnetism in 2D.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03469v3" target="_blank">Pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at next-to-leading order   matched to Parton Shower</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Budassi, C. M. Carloni Calame, M. Ghilardi, A. Gurgone, G. Montagna, M. Moretti, O. Nicrosini, F. Piccinini, F. P. Ucci</p>
            <p>The pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at flavour factories plays a crucial role in the determination of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The recent CMD-3 measurement of the pion form factor via energy scan displays a significant difference with the previous experimental determinations. In order to contribute to an improved theoretical description and simulation of energy scan experiments, we present a calculation of the $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^- (\gamma)$ hadronic channel at next-to-leading order matched to a Parton Shower algorithm in QED and sQED. According to the recent advances in the literature, particular attention is paid to the treatment of the pion composite structure in loop diagrams beyond the commonly used factorised sQED approach, as well as to the modelling of multiple photon radiation through the Parton Shower algorithm. In particular, we carry out a detailed discussion on the inclusion of the pion form factor in the virtual sQED corrections according to two independent methods, inspired by the generalised vector meson dominance model and the dispersive approach, respectively. We find the two methods to be in remarkable agreement. We show phenomenological results for inclusive and differential observables which are relevant for precision energy scan measurements, focusing on the impact of the radiative corrections and the effect of the various approaches for the treatment of the pion form factor. Our calculation is implemented in an updated version of the Monte Carlo event generator BabaYaga@NLO, that can be used for fully exclusive simulations in data analysis.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09607v1" target="_blank">Quantum simulation of bubble nucleation across a quantum phase   transition</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> De Luo, Federica Maria Surace, Arinjoy De, Alessio Lerose, Elizabeth R. Bennewitz, Brayden Ware, Alexander Schuckert, Zohreh Davoudi, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Or Katz, Christopher Monroe</p>
            <p>The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09606v1" target="_blank">Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small   Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steve Cabrel Teguia Kouam, Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Raoult Dabou Teukam, Patrick Mvoto Kongo, Jean-Pierre Nguenang, Serge Guy Nana Engo</p>
            <p>This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16960v2" target="_blank">Static vacuum 3+1 black holes that cannot be put into stationary   rotation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Peraza, Martin Reiris</p>
            <p>We prove that some of the static Myers/Korotkin-Nicolai (MKN) vacuum 3+1 static black holes cannot be put into stationary rotation. Namely, they cannot be deformed into axisymmetric stationary vacuum black holes with non-zero angular momentum. We also prove that this occurs in particular for those MKN solutions for which the distance along the axis between the two poles of the horizon is sufficiently small compared to the square root of its area. The MKN solutions, sometimes called periodic Schwarzschild, are physically regular, have no struts or singularities, but are asymptotically Kasner.   The static rigidity presented here appears to be the first in the literature of General Relativity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09601v1" target="_blank">Real2Render2Real: Scaling Robot Data Without Dynamics Simulation or   Robot Hardware</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Yu, Letian Fu, Huang Huang, Karim El-Refai, Rares Andrei Ambrus, Richard Cheng, Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Ken Goldberg</p>
            <p>Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinwei Deng, Lulu Kang, C. Devon Lin</p>
            <p>Space-filling designs are crucial for efficient computer experiments, enabling accurate surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification in many scientific and engineering applications, such as digital twin systems and cyber-physical systems. In this work, we will provide a comprehensive review on key design methodologies, including Maximin/miniMax designs, Latin hypercubes, and projection-based designs. Moreover, we will connect the space-filling design criteria like the fill distance to Gaussian process performance. Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the practical trade-offs among various design types, with the discussion on emerging challenges in high-dimensional and constrained settings. The paper concludes with future directions in adaptive sampling and machine learning integration, providing guidance for improving computational experiments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14579v2" target="_blank">Non-Hermitian linear perturbation to a Hamiltonian with a constant   electromagnetic field and Hall conductivity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge A. Lizarraga, Kenan Uriostegui</p>
            <p>The stationary Schr\"odinger equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field with a non-Hermitian linear perturbation is studied. The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11772v4" target="_blank">A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$   tension</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. G. Dainotti, B. De Simone, A. Garg, K. Kohri, A. Bashyal, A. Aich, A. Mondal, S. Nagataki, G. Montani, T. Jareen, V. M. Jabir, S. Khanjani, M. Bogdan, N.

            <p>Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant (\texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0}) measurements, ranging from 4 to 6$\sigma$. In the current study, we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, Pantheon+ (P+), Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey, (DES) catalogs combined together into the so-called Master Sample. The sample contains 3714 SNe Ia, and is divided all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Three binning techniques are presented: the equi-population, the moving window (MW), and the equi-spacing in the \texorpdfstring{$\log-z$}{log-z}. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat \texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$CDM}{LCDM} and the \texorpdfstring{$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM}{w0waCDM} models. These \texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0} values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$}{H0(z) = H0tilde / (1 + z)^alpha}, where \texorpdfstring{$\tilde{H}_0$}{H0tilde} is a free parameter representing \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z)$}{H0(z)} fitted in \texorpdfstring{$z=0$}{z=0}, and \texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha} is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by \texorpdfstring{$\alpha \sim 0.01$}{alpha ~ 0.01}, whose consistency with zero ranges from $1 \sigma$ in 5 cases to 1 case at 3 $\sigma$ and 11 cases at $> 3 \sigma$ in several samples and configurations. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</p>
