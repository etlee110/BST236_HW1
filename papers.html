            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Graeme J. Francolini, Thomas B. Britton</p>
            <p>The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06753v1" target="_blank">Case for a unified surrogate modelling framework in the age of AI</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizaveta Semenova</p>
            <p>Surrogate models are widely used in natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning to approximate complex systems and reduce computational costs. However, the current landscape lacks standardisation across key stages of the pipeline, including data collection, sampling design, model class selection, evaluation metrics, and downstream task performance analysis. This fragmentation limits reproducibility, reliability, and cross-domain applicability. The issue has only been exacerbated by the AI revolution and a new suite of surrogate model classes that it offers. In this position paper, we argue for the urgent need for a unified framework to guide the development and evaluation of surrogate models. We outline essential steps for constructing a comprehensive pipeline and discuss alternative perspectives, such as the benefits of domain-specific frameworks. By advocating for a standardised approach, this paper seeks to improve the reliability of surrogate modelling, foster cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer, and, as a result, accelerate scientific progress.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06749v1" target="_blank">Incentivizing Desirable Effort Profiles in Strategic Classification: The   Role of Causality and Uncertainty</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valia Efthymiou, Chara Podimata, Diptangshu Sen, Juba Ziani</p>
            <p>We study strategic classification in binary decision-making settings where agents can modify their features in order to improve their classification outcomes. Importantly, our work considers the causal structure across different features, acknowledging that effort in a given feature may affect other features. The main goal of our work is to understand \emph{when and how much agent effort is invested towards desirable features}, and how this is influenced by the deployed classifier, the causal structure of the agent's features, their ability to modify them, and the information available to the agent about the classifier and the feature causal graph.   In the complete information case, when agents know the classifier and the causal structure of the problem, we derive conditions ensuring that rational agents focus on features favored by the principal. We show that designing classifiers to induce desirable behavior is generally non-convex, though tractable in special cases. We also extend our analysis to settings where agents have incomplete information about the classifier or the causal graph. While optimal effort selection is again a non-convex problem under general uncertainty, we highlight special cases of partial uncertainty where this selection problem becomes tractable. Our results indicate that uncertainty drives agents to favor features with higher expected importance and lower variance, potentially misaligning with principal preferences. Finally, numerical experiments based on a cardiovascular disease risk study illustrate how to incentivize desirable modifications under uncertainty.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06748v1" target="_blank">Institutional Preferences in the Laboratory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiankun Zhong, Nori Jacoby, Ofer Tchernichovski, Seth Frey</p>
            <p>Getting a group to adopt cooperative norms is an enduring challenge. But in real-world settings, individuals don't just passively accept static environments, they act both within and upon the social systems that structure their interactions. Should we expect the dynamism of player-driven changes to the "rules of the game" to hinder cooperation -- because of the substantial added complexity -- or help it, as prosocial agents tweak their environment toward non-zero-sum games? We introduce a laboratory setting to test whether groups can guide themselves to cooperative outcomes by manipulating the environmental parameters that shape their emergent cooperation process. We test for cooperation in a set of economic games that impose different social dilemmas. These games vary independently in the institutional features of stability, efficiency, and fairness. By offering agency over behavior along with second-order agency over the rules of the game, we understand emergent cooperation in naturalistic settings in which the rules of the game are themselves dynamic and subject to choice. The literature on transfer learning in games suggests that interactions between features are important and might aid or hinder the transfer of cooperative learning to new settings.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06709v1" target="_blank">Talagrand Meets Talagrand: Upper and Lower Bounds on Expected Soft   Maxima of Gaussian Processes with Finite Index Sets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifeng Chu, Maxim Raginsky</p>
            <p>Analysis of extremal behavior of stochastic processes is a key ingredient in a wide variety of applications, including probability, statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and learning theory. In this paper, we consider centered Gaussian processes on finite index sets and investigate expected values of their smoothed, or ``soft,'' maxima. We obtain upper and lower bounds for these expected values using a combination of ideas from statistical physics (the Gibbs variational principle for the equilibrium free energy and replica-symmetric representations of Gibbs averages) and from probability theory (Sudakov minoration). These bounds are parametrized by an inverse temperature $\beta > 0$ and reduce to the usual Gaussian maximal inequalities in the zero-temperature limit $\beta \to \infty$. We provide an illustration of our methods in the context of the Random Energy Model, one of the simplest models of physical systems with random disorder.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00359v3" target="_blank">Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Making: Principles, Algorithms   and Case Studies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Emmerich, Andr√© Deutz</p>
            <p>Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06708v1" target="_blank">TEMSET-24K: Densely Annotated Dataset for Indexing Multipart Endoscopic   Videos using Surgical Timeline Segmentation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Bilal, Mahmood Alam, Deepa Bapu, Stephan Korsgen, Neeraj Lal, Simon Bach, Amir M Hajivanand, Muhammed Ali, Kamran Soomro, Iqbal Qasim, Pawe≈Ç Capik, Aslam Khan, Zaheer Khan, Hunaid Vohra, Massimo Caputo, Andrew Beggs, Adnan Qayyum, Junaid Qadir, Shazad Ashraf</p>
            <p>Indexing endoscopic surgical videos is vital in surgical data science, forming the basis for systematic retrospective analysis and clinical performance evaluation. Despite its significance, current video analytics rely on manual indexing, a time-consuming process. Advances in computer vision, particularly deep learning, offer automation potential, yet progress is limited by the lack of publicly available, densely annotated surgical datasets. To address this, we present TEMSET-24K, an open-source dataset comprising 24,306 trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) video micro-clips. Each clip is meticulously annotated by clinical experts using a novel hierarchical labeling taxonomy encompassing phase, task, and action triplets, capturing intricate surgical workflows. To validate this dataset, we benchmarked deep learning models, including transformer-based architectures. Our in silico evaluation demonstrates high accuracy (up to 0.99) and F1 scores (up to 0.99) for key phases like Setup and Suturing. The STALNet model, tested with ConvNeXt, ViT, and SWIN V2 encoders, consistently segmented well-represented phases. TEMSET-24K provides a critical benchmark, propelling state-of-the-art solutions in surgical data science.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06707v1" target="_blank">FinMamba: Market-Aware Graph Enhanced Multi-Level Mamba for Stock   Movement Prediction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Hu, Peiyuan Liu, Yuante Li, Dawei Cheng, Naiqi Li, Tao Dai, Jigang Bao, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
            <p>Recently, combining stock features with inter-stock correlations has become a common and effective approach for stock movement prediction. However, financial data presents significant challenges due to its low signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic complexity of the market, which give rise to two key limitations in existing methods. First, the relationships between stocks are highly influenced by multifaceted factors including macroeconomic market dynamics, and current models fail to adaptively capture these evolving interactions under specific market conditions. Second, for the accuracy and timeliness required by real-world trading, existing financial data mining methods struggle to extract beneficial pattern-oriented dependencies from long historical data while maintaining high efficiency and low memory consumption. To address the limitations, we propose FinMamba, a Mamba-GNN-based framework for market-aware and multi-level hybrid stock movement prediction. Specifically, we devise a dynamic graph to learn the changing representations of inter-stock relationships by integrating a pruning module that adapts to market trends. Afterward, with a selective mechanism, the multi-level Mamba discards irrelevant information and resets states to skillfully recall historical patterns across multiple time scales with linear time costs, which are then jointly optimized for reliable prediction. Extensive experiments on U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FinMamba, achieving state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and trading profitability, while maintaining low computational complexity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisha Geng, Giacomo Scillla, Eva Zurek</p>
            <p>This study investigates 180 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 31 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only nine semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06686v1" target="_blank">Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of   Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</p>
