            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02636v2" target="_blank">Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. A. Ferreira, L. R. Livramento</p>
            <p>We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply our results to construct approximate Skyrme solutions for the $SU(N)$ Skyrme model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07950v1" target="_blank">Localized quasiparticles in a fluxonium with quasi-two-dimensional   amorphous kinetic inductors</a></h3>

            <p>Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07948v2" target="_blank">Pushing the Accuracy Limit of Foundation Neural Network Models with   Quantum Monte Carlo Forces and Path Integrals</a></h3>

            <p>We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy to produce highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets (energies and forces) aimed at deriving Foundation Machine Learning models for molecular simulation. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT), a "Jacob's Ladder" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively parallel GPU-accelerated software with increasing accuracy. Thanks to Exascale, this is the first time that the computationally intensive calculation of Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) forces, and the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces with selected-CI wavefunctions, are computed at such scale at the complete basis-set-limit. To bridge the gap between accurate QC and condensed-phase molecular dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve the FeNNix-Bio1 DFT-based foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled to path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond reactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy. These results demonstrate the promise of Exascale to deepen our understanding of the inner machinery of complex biosystems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07944v1" target="_blank">Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tadahiro Oh, Younes Zine</p>
            <p>We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\beta^2 > 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\beta^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\beta^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\beta^2 =8\pi$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07299v4" target="_blank">Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of   von Neumann algebras</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauritz van Luijk, Alexander Stottmeister, Reinhard F. Werner, Henrik Wilming</p>
            <p>We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07941v1" target="_blank">Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Asaka, Ryusei Minamikawa</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal {\it coin} state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05400v2" target="_blank">A Convenient Representation Theory of Lorentzian Pseudo-Tensors:   $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ in $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Craig McRae</p>
            <p>A novel approach to the finite dimensional representation theory of the entire Lorentz group $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ is presented. It is shown how the entire Lorentz group may be understood as a semi-direct product between its identity component and the Klein four group of spacetime reflections: $\operatorname{O}(1,3) = \operatorname{SO}^+(1,3) \rtimes \operatorname{K}_4$. This gives way to a convenient classification of tensors transforming under $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$, namely that there are four representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ for each representation of $\operatorname{SO}^+(1,3)$, and it is shown how the representation theory of the Klein group $\operatorname{K}_4$ allows for simple book keeping of the spacetime reflection properties of general Lorentzian tensors, and combinations thereof, with several examples given. There is a brief discussion of the time reversal of the electromagnetic field, concluding in agreement with standard texts such as Jackson, and works by Malament.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07935v1" target="_blank">Stacking-induced ferroelectricity in tetralayer graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Singh, Shuigang Xu, Patrick Johansen Sarsfield, Pablo Diaz Nunez, Ziwei Wang, Sergey Slizovskiy, Nicholas Kay, Jun Yin, Yashar Mayamei, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Qian Yang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Vladimir I. Falko, Artem Mishchenko</p>
            <p>Recent studies have reported emergent ferroelectric behavior in twisted or moir\'e-engineered graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, yet the microscopic origin of this effect remains under debate. Pristine mono- or few-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice, making the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked graphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and mirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically switchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene polytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from asymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report robust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits pronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation, with the effect persisting up to room temperature. This hysteresis originates from reversible layer-polarized charge reordering, driven by gate-induced transitions between ABCB and BCBA stacking configurations -- without requiring moir\'e superlattices. Our findings establish stacking-order-induced symmetry breaking as a fundamental route to electronic ferroelectricity in graphene and open pathways for non-volatile memory applications based on naturally occurring mixed-stacked multilayer graphene.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13352v2" target="_blank">Post-Newtonian limit of generalized scalar-teleparallel theories of   gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Hohmann, Ulbossyn Ualikhanova</p>
            <p>We propose a general class of scalar-teleparallel theories, which are based on a scalar field which is coupled to a flat connection with torsion and nonmetricity, and study its post-Newtonian limit using the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism. We find that among this class there are theories whose post-Newtonian limit fully agrees with general relativity; for others only the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deviate from their general relativity values $\beta = \gamma = 1$, while all other parameters remain the same, thus preserving total momentum conservation, local Lorentz invariance and local position invariance; finally, we also find theories whose post-Newtonian limit is pathological. Our main result is a full classification of the proposed theories into these different cases. We apply our findings to a number of simpler classes of theories and show that for these a subset of the aforementioned cases can be found.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07933v1" target="_blank">Geometric and Dosimetric Validation of Deformable Image Registration for   Prostate MR-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor N. Malkov, Iymad R. Mansour, Vickie Kong, Winnie Li, Jennifer Dang, Parisa Sadeghi, Inmaculada Navarro, Jerusha Padayachee, Peter Chung, Jeff D. Winter, Tony Tadic</p>
            <p>Objective: Quantify geometric and dosimetric accuracy of a novel prostate MR-to-MR deformable image registration (DIR) approach to support MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy dose accumulation.   Approach: We evaluated DIR accuracy in 25 patients treated with 30 Gy in 5 fractions on a 1.5 T MR-linac using an adaptive workflow. A reference MR was used for planning, with three images collected at each fraction: adapt MR for adaptive planning, verify MR for pretreatment position verification and beam-on for capturing anatomy during radiation delivery. We assessed three DIR approaches: intensity-based, intensity-based with controlling structures (CS) and novel intensity based with controlling structures and points of interest (CS+P). DIRs were performed between the reference and fraction images and within fractions. We propagated CTV, bladder, and rectum contours using the DIRs and compared to manual contours using Dice similarity coefficient, mean distance to agreement (DTAmean), and dose-volume metrics.   Results: CS and CS+P improved geometric agreement between contours over intensity-only DIR. DTAmean for reference-to-beam-on intensity-only DIR was 0.131+/-0.009cm (CTV), 0.46+/-0.08cm (bladder), and 0.154+/-0.013cm (rectum). For the CS, the values were 0.018+/-0.002cm, 0.388+/-0.14cm, and 0.036+/-0.013cm. For CS+P these values were 0.015+/-0.001cm, 0.025+/-0.004cm, and 0.021+/-0.002cm. Dosimetrically, comparing CS and CS+P for reference to beam-on DIRs resulted in a change of CTV D98% from [-29cGy, 19cGy] to [-18cGy, 26cGy], rectum D1cc from [-106cGy, 72cGy] to [-52cGy, 74cGy], and bladder D5cc from [-51cGy, 544cGy] to [-79cGy, 36cGy].   Significance: CS improved geometric and dosimetric accuracy over intensity-only DIR, with CS+P providing the most consistent performance. However, session image segmentation remains a challenge, which may be addressed with automated contouring.</p>
