            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08006v1" target="_blank">Dreamland: Controllable World Creation with Simulator and Generative   Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sicheng Mo, Ziyang Leng, Leon Liu, Weizhen Wang, Honglin He, Bolei Zhou</p>
            <p>Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08000v1" target="_blank">Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from   Fractional Chern Insulators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07997v1" target="_blank">Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent   Conversational AI System</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Yuan Tian, Jiansong Zhang</p>
            <p>The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12 participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific support for construction workers.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07995v1" target="_blank">Orbit dimensions in linear and Gaussian quantum optics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliott Z. Mamon</p>
            <p>In sub-universal quantum platforms such as linear or Gaussian quantum optics, quantum states can behave as different resources, in regard to the extent of their accessible state space (called their orbit) under the action of the restricted unitary group. We propose to study the dimension of a quantum state's orbit (as a manifold in the Hilbert space), a simple yet nontrivial topological property that can quantify "how many" states it can reach. As natural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone can reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary transformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward way to compute orbit dimensions for states of finite support in the Fock basis, by leveraging the group's Lie algebra. We also study genericity and robustness properties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate them experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the Gaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be universal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable setting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our work in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture which we do not prove.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07994v1" target="_blank">Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy   power spectrum</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hernán E. Noriega, Josue De-Santiago, Gabriela Garcia-Arroyo, Jorge Venzor, Abdel Pérez-Lorenzana</p>
            <p>This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu< 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu < 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14904v3" target="_blank">Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Joseph Carrasco, Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Diederik Roest</p>
            <p>The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07989v1" target="_blank">Photon rings in a holographic toy model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stéphane Detournay, Sahaja Kanuri, Alexandru Lupsasca, Philippe Spindel, Quentin Vandermiers, Raphaela Wutte</p>
            <p>Light circling around an astrophysical black hole can spend a long time skirting its unstably bound photon orbits before escaping to infinity. To a distant observer, this orbiting light would appear as a bright ring encircling the image of the black hole. Though not yet resolved by radio-interferometric observations from the ground, this ``photon ring'' will be the target of future space-based black hole observations. Motivated by this experimental prospect, studies have sought to elucidate the theoretical connections between the photon ring -- an observable, classical effect -- and the putative holographic description of black holes in quantum gravity. General relativity predicts that the detailed structure of the photon ring encodes the high-frequency (eikonal) spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted by a perturbed black hole as it rings down, and also that the photon ring displays an emergent conformal symmetry that acts upon this spectrum. In holography, the classical QNM frequencies are expected to map to Ruelle resonances of the dual quantum theory. In this paper, we explore these connections in a lower-dimensional toy model based on Warped AdS$_3$ black holes that shares many features with the (3+1)-dimensional Kerr background -- including a photon ring at finite radius -- while still providing analytic control of the QNM frequencies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07983v1" target="_blank">Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in   Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Mahdi Mastoor, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh</p>
            <p>We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07121v2" target="_blank">The Value of Battery Energy Storage in the Continuous Intraday Market:   Forecast vs. Perfect Foresight Strategies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothée Hornek, Youngsub Lee, Sergio Potenciano Menci, Ivan Pavić</p>
            <p>Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) can provide flexibility to the power system and capture shortterm price volatility by shifting energy in time through controlled charging and discharging. The highly volatile European continuous intraday (CID) market allows trading until just a few minutes before physical delivery, offering significant earning potential. However, its high trading frequency poses substantial modeling challenges. Accurate modeling of BESSs trading in the CID market is essential to estimate revenue potential and optimize trading strategies. Additionally, comparing CID profits with other spot markets helps determine whether participating in the CID is worthwhile despite its complexity. We propose a forecast-driven model to optimize BESS trading in the CID market. Our strategy employs a rolling window modeling framework to capture market dynamics. Price forecasts for impending CID products are generated at the beginning of each window and used to optimize trading schedules for subsequent execution. We also benchmark our approach across various spot markets, offering a broad cross-market profit comparison. We evaluate our forecast-driven model across different BESS power-to-capacity ratios, comparing it to a perfect-foresight scenario and key CID market indices, such as ID1 and ID3. Using real 2023 German CID data, a 1 MW/1 MWh system adopting our method earns EUR 146 237, only 11% below perfect foresight, surpassing all other markets and indices. Our approach surpasses ID1 and ID3 by over 4% and 32%, respectively, confirming ID1 as a reliable lower-bound estimate for earnings potential in the CID market.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19992v3" target="_blank">Towards Non-Abelian Quantum Signal Processing: Efficient Control of   Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Architectures</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shraddha Singh, Baptiste Royer, Steven M. Girvin</p>
            <p>Robust quantum control is crucial for achieving operations below the quantum error correction threshold. Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms. Originating from composite pulse techniques in NMR, QSP enhances robustness against systematic control errors. We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator. This sequence achieves at least a $4.5\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art abelian QSP pulse BB1, while maintaining performance. Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection. Furthermore, we propose a high-fidelity QSP-based end-of-the-line GKP readout and a measurement-free, error-corrected gate teleportation protocol for logical operations on GKP bosonic qudits, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical and experimentally realistic versions of the GKP code. Finally, we showcase a GCR-based phase estimation algorithm for oscillator-based quantum computing.</p>
