            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03734v1" target="_blank">Highly squeezed nanophotonic quantum microcombs with broadband frequency   tunability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichen Shen, Ping-Yen Hsieh, Dhruv Srinivasan, Antoine Henry, Gregory Moille, Sashank Kaushik Sridhar, Alessandro Restelli, You-Chia Chang, Kartik Srinivasan, Thomas A. Smith, Avik Dutt</p>
            <p>Squeezed light offers genuine quantum advantage in enhanced sensing and quantum computation; yet the level of squeezing or quantum noise reduction generated from nanophotonic chips has been limited. In addition to strong quantum noise reduction, key desiderata for such a nanophotonic squeezer include frequency agility or tunability over a broad frequency range, and simultaneous operation in many distinct, well-defined quantum modes (qumodes). Here we present a strongly overcoupled silicon nitride squeezer based on a below-threshold optical parametric amplifier (OPA) that produces directly detected squeezing of 5.6 dB $\pm$ 0.2 dB, surpassing previous demonstrations in both continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We introduce a seed-assisted detection technique into such nanophotonic squeezers that reveals a quantum frequency comb (QFC) of 16 qumodes, with a separation of 11~THz between the furthest qumode pair, while maintaining a strong squeezing. Additionally, we report spectral tuning of a qumode comb pair over one free-spectral range of the OPA, thus bridging the spacing between the discrete modes of the QFC. Our results significantly advance both the generation and detection of nanophotonic squeezed light in a broadband and multimode platform, establishing a scalable, chip-integrated path for compact quantum sensors and continuous-variable quantum information processing systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01913v2" target="_blank">Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Khalatpour, Luke Qi, Martin M. Fejer, Amir Safavi-Naeini</p>
            <p>Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05767v2" target="_blank">Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics Yields Anharmonic Rabi Oscillations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Hsiu Hsieh, Roel Tempelaar</p>
            <p>We apply a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) approach to the quantum Rabi model, involving a classical optical field coupled self-consistently to a quantum two-level system. Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17773v3" target="_blank">Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21760v2" target="_blank">No-Go Theorems for Universal Entanglement Purification</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Allen Zang, Xinan Chen, Eric Chitambar, Martin Suchara, Tian Zhong</p>
            <p>An entanglement purification protocol (EPP) aims to transform multiple noisy entangled states into a single entangled state with higher fidelity. In this work we consider EPPs that always yield an output fidelity no worse than each of the original noisy states, a property we call universality. We prove there is no $n$-to-1 EPP implementable by local operations and classical communication that is universal for all two-qubit entangled states, whereas such an EPP is possible using more general positive partial transpose-preserving (PPT) operations. We also show that universality is not possible by bilocal Clifford EPPs even when restricted to states with fidelities above an arbitrarily high threshold.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03727v1" target="_blank">Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiz Menon, Pablo de Castro, Celia Anteneodo</p>
            <p>The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03726v1" target="_blank">Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03724v1" target="_blank">Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Nachman, Dennis Noll</p>
            <p>Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool for data analysis in particle physics. Simulated events are typically produced alongside weights that redistribute the cross section across the phase space. Latent degrees of freedom introduce a distribution of weights at a given point in the phase space, which can include negative values. Several post-hoc reweighting methods have been developed to eliminate the negative weights. All of these methods share the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of phase space. We introduce an alternative approach with a potentially simpler learning task. Instead of reweighting to the average, we refine the initial weights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent factor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight distribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase space is processed using neural networks for the refinement. Using both realistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method is able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03722v1" target="_blank">The LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest muon $g-2$   and dark matter results</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Liang, Kun Wang, Jun Zhao, Jingya Zhu</p>
            <p>Among the electroweakinos, the weak gauginos have the largest production rate at the LHC and should therefore be the primary focus of searches. In this work, we examine the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest constraints from the muon $g-2$ anomaly and dark matter (DM) observations. To simultaneously account for the observed $5\sigma$ deviation in muon $g-2$ and the correct DM relic abundance, the DM candidate in the MSSM must be bino-like: wino- or higgsino-like neutralinos require TeV-scale masses to avoid underabundance, rendering the electroweakino spectrum too heavy to yield a sizable $g-2$ contribution. Moreover, tight direct detection limits disfavor light higgsinos, which can induce sizable DM-nucleon scattering via bino-higgsino mixing. We thus focus on scenarios with a bino-like LSP and relatively heavy higgsinos. Two classes of wino spectra are considered: a light-wino scenario (LWo) with $m_{\tilde{W}} \lesssim 1$~TeV, and a heavy-wino scenario (HWo) with $m_{\tilde{W}} \gtrsim 1$~TeV. For each, we delineate the viable parameter space under current constraints and assess the discovery potential at future LHC stages. We find that while the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) can probe a portion of the parameter space, the high-energy 27~TeV LHC (HE-LHC) is capable of covering most of it.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19966v2" target="_blank">Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie Parham</p>
            <p>We introduce the magic hierarchy, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.   We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.   More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.</p>
