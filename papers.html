            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05347v1" target="_blank">Neural Inverse Rendering from Propagating Light</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anagh Malik, Benjamin Attal, Andrew Xie, Matthew O'Toole, David B. Lindell</p>
            <p>We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05341v1" target="_blank">Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via   Spatial Reasoning</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian Ran, Yixuan Li, Linning Xu, Mulin Yu, Bo Dai</p>
            <p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05337v1" target="_blank">Momentum fraction and hard scale dependence of double parton scattering</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joao Vitor C. Lovato, Edgar Huayra, Emmanuel G. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>The effective cross section of double parton scattering in high-energy hadron collisions has been measured in proton--proton collisions, with significant variation among final-state observables, contrary to the idea of a universal value. Building upon our previous work, we incorporate the dependence on both the parton longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ and the process energy hard scale $\mu$ into the transverse part of the double parton distributions, using a Gaussian profile. Employing the experimental data from the LHC and Tevatron experiments (covering different processes, kinematic configurations, and center--of--mass energies), we perform a global fit of the model, extracting the parameters that describe the proton structure. With this result, it becomes possible to calculate the effective cross section for others observables, and we provide predictions for future measurements at the LHC.</p>

            <p>We show how the fundamental entropic inequality proved recently in [arXiv:2408.15306] can be used to obtain a quite accurate upper bound on the Holevo quantity of a discrete ensemble of quantum states expressed via the probabilities and the metric characteristics of this ensembles.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05326v1" target="_blank">Searching for Hidden Sector Particles at Neutrino Telescopes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Airen, Zackaria Chacko, Can Kilic, Ram Purandhar Reddy Sudha</p>
            <p>We explore the possibility of directly detecting light, long-lived hidden sector particles at the IceCube neutrino telescope. Such particles frequently arise in non-minimal hidden sectors that couple to the Standard Model through portal operators. We consider two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, which arises from a neutrino portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced inside the detector by the collision of an energetic neutrino with a nucleon, giving rise to a visible cascade. This new state then decays into a hidden sector daughter, which can naturally be long-lived. The eventual decay of the daughter particle back to Standard Model states gives rise to a second cascade inside the detector. This scenario therefore gives rise to a characteristic "double bang" signal arising from the two distinct cascades. In the second scenario, which arises from a hypercharge portal interaction, a hidden sector particle is produced outside the detector by the collision of an atmospheric muon with a nucleon. This new state promptly decays into a pair of hidden sector daughters that are long-lived. If both daughters decay into Standard Model states inside the detector, we again obtain a double-bang signal from the two distinct cascades. We explore the reach of IceCube for these two scenarios and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the sensitivity to hidden sector models in the mass range from about a GeV to about 20 GeV.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05325v1" target="_blank">Seeing the Invisible: Machine learning-Based QPI Kernel Extraction via   Latent Alignment</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingshuai Ji, Haomin Zhuang, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Xiaolong Liu, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
            <p>Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen kernels.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05324v1" target="_blank">A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon   Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling-Yan Hung, Kaixin Ji, Ce Shen, Yidun Wan, Yu Zhao</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05323v1" target="_blank">Non-Perturbative Topological Gadgets for Many-Body Coupling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Headley, Nicholas Chancellor</p>
            <p>Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex gadget-like constructions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05319v1" target="_blank">Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05317v1" target="_blank">ProJo4D: Progressive Joint Optimization for Sparse-View Inverse Physics   Estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Rho, Jun Myeong Choi, Biswadip Dey, Roni Sengupta</p>
            <p>Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data, however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable, real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization, directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity, leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state, and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.
