            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09273v2" target="_blank">Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maciej J. Capinski, Marian Gidea</p>
            <p>We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11449v1" target="_blank">SymTFT construction of gapless exotic-foliated dual models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Apruzzi, Francesco Bedogna, Salvo Mancani</p>
            <p>We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generates gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08663v2" target="_blank">A relativistic non-perturbative local model of fractons and its   non-local perturbative hidden sector</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo F. Sobreiro</p>
            <p>We construct, from first principles, a covariant local model for scalar fractonic matter coupled to a symmetric tensor gauge field. The free gauge field action is just the one of the Blasi-Maggiore model. The scalar sector, describing fracton charges, is a non-trivial covariant generalization of Pretko's quartic model. Because the model has no quadratic term in the scalar field, a direct perturbative treatment fails. Remarkably, by performing a suitable change of variables, we demonstrate that the action can be driven to a perturbative effective action. However, at the price of carrying non-local interacting terms. We study the perturbative regime of the model first by analyzing the classical field equations and some possible simple solutions, which are in accordance with the expected immobile behavior of fractons. We also derive the fracton dispersion relation and, by playing with the parameters of the model, show that there are at least six distinct phases: one with two massive fractonic modes, one of them being tachyonic; one with massless states associated with a long-range attractive potential; a mixed phase with one massive and one massless state; another one where physical states of the scalar field cannot occur at all in the physical spectrum; a massive phase with states of two different masses; and second phase where the scalar field cannot be associated with physical particles, in spite of its mass being real. Moreover, we find evidence that fractonic bound states emerge in the model for some of these phases.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11444v1" target="_blank">Fault Tolerant Quantum Simulation via Symplectic Transvections</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuangzhuang Chen, Jack Owen Weinberg, Narayanan Rengaswamy</p>
            <p>Conventional approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing realize logical circuits gate-by-gate, synthesizing each gate independently on one or more code blocks. This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in quantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the execution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global structure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes. These results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies for fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08932v2" target="_blank">AC-LGADs Fermilab Front-End Electronics Characterization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> René Ríos, Esteban Felipe Molina Cardenas, Cristian Peña, Orlando Soto, William Brooks, Artur Apresyan, Sergey Los, Claudio San Martín</p>
            <p>We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the signal resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\: ps$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11439v1" target="_blank">Combined Evidence for the $X_{17}$ Boson After PADME Results on Resonant   Production in Positron Annihilation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Arias-Aragón, Giovanni Grilli di Cortona, Enrico Nardi, Claudio Toni</p>
            <p>The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati has reported an excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons. While the global significance remains at the $1.8\,\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around $\sqrt{s} \sim 17\,\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C, thereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly involving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of this independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear physics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88 \pm 0.05\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations alone by more than a factor of two.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11437v1" target="_blank">Ghostly interactions in (1+1) dimensional classical field theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cédric Deffayet, Aaron Held, Shinji Mukohyama, Alexander Vikman</p>
            <p>We investigate the classical stability of two coupled scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms evolving in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In the first part, we characterise unquenched ghostly interactions and present numerical solutions that support the following statements. First, the classical instability is not instantaneous and can even be benign, i.e., free of finite-time singularities. Second, while the classical instability can cascade towards higher frequency excitations, it is not driven by high frequency modes: At fixed amplitude, high-frequency modes are more stable than low-frequency modes. In the second part, we demonstrate that the classical instability can be quenched by mass terms. In particular, we exemplify that heavy high-frequency ghost fields seem to not violate the decoupling theorem and can be integrated out classically. In the third part, we demonstrate how self-interactions can quench the instability, for instance, by postponing its onset to parametrically large times. Extrapolating numerical results at large but finite evolution time to infinite evolution time, we demonstrate that classical fluctuations around trivial and nontrivial field-theory vacua are increasingly long-lived with (i) smaller initial amplitude of fluctuations, (ii) higher initial frequency of fluctuations, (iii) larger masses of the fields, or (iv) weaker interaction coupling. Moreover, our numerical simulations for field-theoretical generalisations of some globally-stable ghostly mechanical models do not feature any instability.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11433v1" target="_blank">Predicting Wave Dynamics using Deep Learning with Multistep Integration   Inspired Attention and Physics-Based Loss Decomposition</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indu Kant Deo, Rajeev K. Jaiman</p>
            <p>In this paper, we present a physics-based deep learning framework for data-driven prediction of wave propagation in fluid media. The proposed approach, termed Multistep Integration-Inspired Attention (MI2A), combines a denoising-based convolutional autoencoder for reduced latent representation with an attention-based recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory cells for time evolution of reduced coordinates. This proposed architecture draws inspiration from classical linear multistep methods to enhance stability and long-horizon accuracy in latent-time integration. Despite the efficiency of hybrid neural architectures in modeling wave dynamics, autoregressive predictions are often prone to accumulating phase and amplitude errors over time. To mitigate this issue within the MI2A framework, we introduce a novel loss decomposition strategy that explicitly separates the training loss function into distinct phase and amplitude components. We assess the performance of MI2A against two baseline reduced-order models trained with standard mean-squared error loss: a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network and a variant using Luong-style attention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MI2A model, we consider three benchmark wave propagation problems of increasing complexity, namely one-dimensional linear convection, the nonlinear viscous Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Our results demonstrate that the MI2A framework significantly improves the accuracy and stability of long-term predictions, accurately preserving wave amplitude and phase characteristics. Compared to the standard long-short term memory and attention-based models, MI2A-based deep learning exhibits superior generalization and temporal accuracy, making it a promising tool for real-time wave modeling.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11432v1" target="_blank">Analysis of Preheat Propagation in MagLIF-like Plasmas</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Garcia-Rubio, Scott Davidson, C. Leland Ellison, Nathan B. Meezan, Douglas S. Miller, Nantas Nardelli, Adam Reyes, Paul F. Schmit, Hardeep Sullan</p>
            <p>The preheat and pre-magnetization of the fuel are essential steps in the design of Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) configurations. Typically, the energy of the preheat laser is deposited in a central region of the fuel and propagates outward generating magneto-hydrodynamic structures that impact the fuel mass distribution and magnetic flux compression during the subsequent implosion. We present a theoretical analysis of preheat propagation in a magnetized plasma under conditions typical for MagLIF. The analysis is based on the acoustic time scale for the propagation of pressure disturbances being much shorter than the conductive time scale for heat diffusion. In this regime, the preheat-driven expansion induces the stratification of fuel mass and magnetic field, which accumulate in a dense outer shelf bounded by the leading shock. We derive self-similar solutions of the mathematical model that describe the hydrodynamic profiles of the expansion, and evaluate the evolution of the magnetic field in this configuration. The model is supported by FLASH simulations of preheat propagation. Our analysis shows that the regions where the magnetization of the fuel is significant tend to become localized asymptotically in time at the interface separating the outer shelf from the inner hot core. We assess the implications of this stratification on the magnetic flux conservation and performance of fully integrated MagLIF FLASH simulations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11430v1" target="_blank">The 2D Lorentz-violating fermionic Casimir effect under thermal   conditions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. E. L. de Farias, M. A. Anacleto, Iver Brevik, F. A. Brito, E. Passos, Amilcar Queiroz, João R. L. Santos</p>
            <p>In the present work, we explore the dimensional projection method applied to a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with the CPT-even dimension-six extension. Due to the dimensional reduction of a fermionic system from $4D$ to $2D$, it is possible to study the influence of LIV on the Casimir effect under the MIT bag boundary condition model in a low-dimensional setting, where results are obtained without any approximations for a null-temperature system. Moreover, the Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system in a LIV context. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes.</p>
