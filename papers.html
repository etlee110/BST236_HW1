            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04618v2" target="_blank">Robust Quantum Control for Bragg Pulse Design in Atom Interferometry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke S. Baker, Andre Luiz P. de Lima, Andrew Harter, Ceren Uzun, Jr-Shin Li, Anatoly Zlotnik, Michael J. Martin, Malcolm G. Boshier</p>
            <p>We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy signal that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06780v1" target="_blank">Breaking Quantum Key Distributions under Quantum Switch-Based Attack</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumit Nandi, Biswaranjan Panda, Pankaj Agrawal, Arun K Pati</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure key sharing between distant parties, with several protocols proven resilient against conventional eavesdropping strategies. Here, we introduce a new attack scenario where an eavesdropper, Eve, exploits a quantum switch using the indefinite causal order to intercept and manipulate quantum communication channel. Using multiple metrics such as the information gain, mutual information, and Bell violation, we demonstrate that the presence of a quantum switch significantly compromises QKD security. Our results highlight a previously overlooked vulnerability, emphasizing the need for countermeasures against quantum-controlled adversarial strategies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02667v2" target="_blank">Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high   virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(α_{s}   α_{em})$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Kumar, Gojko Vujanovic</p>
            <p>In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{s}\alpha_{em})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair-production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision-kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06771v1" target="_blank">Unsupervised Particle Tracking with Neuromorphic Computing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuele Coradin, Fabio Cufino, Muhammad Awais, Tommaso Dorigo, Enrico Lupi, Eleonora Porcu, Jinu Raj, Fredrik Sandin, Mia Tosi</p>
            <p>We study the application of a neural network architecture for identifying charged particle trajectories via unsupervised learning of delays and synaptic weights using a spike-time-dependent plasticity rule. In the considered model, the neurons receive time-encoded information on the position of particle hits in a tracking detector for a particle collider, modeled according to the geometry of the Compact Muon Solenoid Phase II detector. We show how a spiking neural network is capable of successfully identifying in a completely unsupervised way the signal left by charged particles in the presence of conspicuous noise from accidental or combinatorial hits. These results open the way to applications of neuromorphic computing to particle tracking, motivating further studies into its potential for real-time, low-power particle tracking in future high-energy physics experiments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06767v1" target="_blank">Fat-Tree QRAM: A High-Bandwidth Shared Quantum Random Access Memory for   Parallel Queries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shifan Xu, Alvin Lu, Yongshan Ding</p>
            <p>Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a crucial architectural component for querying classical or quantum data in superposition, enabling algorithms with wide-ranging applications in quantum arithmetic, quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we introduce Fat-Tree QRAM, a novel query architecture capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries simultaneously while maintaining desirable scalings in query speed and fidelity. Specifically, Fat-Tree QRAM performs $O(\log (N))$ independent queries in $O(\log (N))$ time using $O(N)$ qubits, offering immense parallelism benefits over traditional QRAM architectures. To demonstrate its experimental feasibility, we propose modular and on-chip implementations of Fat-Tree QRAM based on superconducting circuits and analyze their performance and fidelity under realistic parameters. Furthermore, a query scheduling protocol is presented to maximize hardware utilization and access the underlying data at an optimal rate. These results suggest that Fat-Tree QRAM is an attractive architecture in a shared memory system for practical quantum computing.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13092v2" target="_blank">Chiral perturbation theory and Bose-Einstein condensation in QCD</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens O. Andersen, Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Qing Yu, Hua Zhou</p>
            <p>We present recent results in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin $\mu_I$ and strangeness $\mu_s$ chemical potentials at zero temperature. The phase diagram to ${\cal O}(p^2)$ in the $\mu_I$--$\mu_S$ plane is mapped out with and without electromagnetic effects. The phase diagram consists of a vacuum phase and three Bose-condensed phases with condensates of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^{0}/\bar{K}^0$, respectively. Including electromagnetic interactions, the Bose-condensed phases become Higgs phases via the Higgs mechanism. The tree-level spectrum for the mesons and gauge bosons is also derived. We calculate the pressure, energy density, isospin density, and speed of sound in the pion-condensed phase to ${\cal O}(p^4)$ for three-flavor $\chi$PT. The results are compared with recent lattice simulations and the agreement is very good for isospin chemical potentials up to approximately 200 MeV. Moreover, by integrating out the $s$-quark, we show that the thermodynamic quantities can be mapped onto their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized parameters. %to ${\cal O}(p^6)$ for two-flavor $\chi$PT in the chiral limit. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the energy density can be matched onto the classic result by Lee, Huang and Yang (LHY) for a dilute Bose, with an $s$-wave scattering length that includes radiative corrections. The breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry in the Bose-condensed phases gives rise to a Goldstone bosons, whose dispersion is linear for momenta $p\ll\mu_I$. In this regime, we use Son's prescription to construct an effective theory for the Goldstone field which is valid in this regime. It is shown that its damping rate is of order $p^5$. This result is in agreement with Beliav's for a dilute Bose gas.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05630v2" target="_blank">Collisional charging of dust particles by suprathermal plasmas. II --   Regularized Kappa distributions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudi Gaelzer, Luiz Fernando Ziebell</p>
            <p>We study the effects of the velocity distribution functions of the plasma particles on the equilibrium charge of dust grains, acquired through inelastic collisions of the particles with the grains. This paper is the second in a series of two papers on the subject. Here, we consider the charging process when the plasma particles are statistically described by the recently proposed regularized Kappa distribution functions, which allow for extreme suprathermal states, characterized by extremely low values of the kappa index, previously forbidden to the standard Kappa distributions, whose effects on dust charging were studied in Paper I of this series. We analyse the effects that extreme suprathermal states of the plasma particles have on dust charging and verify conditions for the uncommon result of positive equilibrium charge, employing two different models for the regularized Kappa distributions, one with kinetic temperature dependent on the kappa index, and another where the temperature is kappa-independent.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08055v2" target="_blank">Decoherence time of the ground state spin of $V_{B}$ centers in   hexagonal boron nitride</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Tarighi Tabesh, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>The ground-state spin of optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers a promising platform for quantum information applications, such as qubits for quantum computing and nanoscale sensing. A key characteristic of a qubit is its decoherence time, as its duration and controllability are critical for practical applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the electron spin dephasing time of the negatively charged boron vacancies, $V_{B}$ centers, in the hBN lattice by considering the dipolar hyperfine as well as spin-phonon interactions. We employ an approximate method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to take into account a large number of nuclear spins and Debye model to consider the effect of lattice phonons. We show that, in the presence of the dipolar hyperfine interactions, Hahn-echo coherence time of the $V_{B}$ electron spin is approximately $30\: \mathrm{\mu s}$ at room temperature. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the $V_{B}$ defect decoherence in the hBN, which might be used for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11002v2" target="_blank">Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing   multicellular spheroids</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torben Sunkel, Lukas Hupe, Philip Bittihn</p>
            <p>Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00365v2" target="_blank">Cross Helicity and the Helium Abundance as an in situ Metric of Solar   Wind Acceleration</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. L. Alterman, R. D'Amicis</p>
            <p>The two-state solar wind paradigm is based on observations showing that slow and fast solar wind have distinct properties like helium abundances, kinetic signatures, elemental composition, and charge-state ratios. Nominally, the fast wind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open to the heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sources that are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solar wind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm. It has slow wind speeds but is highly Alfv\'enic, i.e. has a high correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations along with low compressibility typical of Alfv\'en waves, which is typically observed in fast wind. Its other properties are also more similar to the fast than slow wind. From 28 years of Wind observations at 1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$), Alfv\'enicity ($\left|\sigma_c\right|$), and solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than the minimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions. We infer that the Alfv\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating from open-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasma from intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications for solar wind acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination of helium abundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar wind categorization scheme that illustrates the transition in observations of solar wind at 1 AU from magnetically closed to magnetically open sources.</p>
