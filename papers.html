            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18155v1" target="_blank">Modeling Cosmic-Ray Transport: Magnetized versus Unmagnetized Motion in   Astrophysical Magnetic Turbulence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremiah Lübke, Patrick Reichherzer, Sophie Aerdker, Frederic Effenberger, Mike Wilbert, Horst Fichtner, Rainer Grauer</p>
            <p>Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem, and despite decades of study the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focused attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behavior emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18151v1" target="_blank">WonderPlay: Dynamic 3D Scene Generation from a Single Image and Actions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zizhang Li, Hong-Xing Yu, Wei Liu, Yin Yang, Charles Herrmann, Gordon Wetzstein, Jiajun Wu</p>
            <p>WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input. Code will be made public. Project website: https://kyleleey.github.io/WonderPlay/</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18147v1" target="_blank">Nonadiabatic reactive scattering of hydrogen on different surface facets   of copper</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wojciech G. Stark, Connor L. Box, Matthias Sachs, Nils Hertl, Reinhard J. Maurer</p>
            <p>Dissociative chemisorption is a key process in hydrogen-metal surface chemistry, where nonadiabatic effects due to low-lying electron-hole-pair excitations may affect reaction outcomes. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations can capture weak nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, but require as input energy landscapes and electronic friction tensors. Here, we present full-dimensional machine learning surrogate models of the electronic friction tensor to study reactive hydrogen chemistry at the low-index surface facets Cu(100), Cu(110), Cu(111), and Cu(211). We combine these surrogate models with machine learning interatomic potentials to simulate quantum-state-resolved H$_2$ reactive scattering on pristine copper surfaces. The predicted sticking coefficient and survival probabilities are in excellent agreement with experiment. Comparison between adiabatic and nonadiabatic simulations reveals that the influence of electron-hole pair excitations on the scattering dynamics is weak and that the probability for dissociative adsorption is dominated by the shape of the underlying potential energy surface and the initial vibrational quantum state. Nonadiabatic effects only lead to subtle changes in rovibrationally inelastic state-to-state scattering probabilities. The differences between jellium-based isotropic local density friction and full ab-initio response-theory-based orbital-dependent friction are even more subtle. The presented machine learning models represent the most accurate publicly available, full-dimensional models for H$_2$ on copper to date.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18145v1" target="_blank">Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion   models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Swailem, Ulrich Dobramysl, Ruslan Mukhamadiarov, Uwe C. Täuber</p>
            <p>We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and reacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based computer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate and beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of simulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical properties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical investigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In addition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for avoiding them.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18144v1" target="_blank">Grand Theft Moons. Formation of habitable moons around giant planets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoltan Dencs, Vera Dobos, Zsolt Regaly</p>
            <p>Of the few thousand discovered exoplanets, a significant number orbit in the habitable zone of their star. Many of them are gas giants lacking a rocky surface and solid water reservoirs necessary for life as we know it. The search for habitable environments may extend to the moons of these giant planets. No confirmed exomoon discoveries have been made as of today, but promising candidates are known. Theories suggest that moon formation is a natural process in planetary systems. We aim to study moon formation around giant planets in a phase similar to the final assembly of planet formation. We search for conditions for forming the largest moons with the highest possibility in circumplanetary disks, and investigate whether the resulting moons can be habitable. We determined the fraction of the circumplanetary disk's mass converted into moons using numerical N-body simulations where moon embryos grow via embryo-satellitesimal collisions, investigated in disks around giant planets consisting of 100 fully interacting embryos and 1000 satellitesimals. In fiducial simulations, a 10 Jupiter-mass planet orbited a solar analog star at distances of 1-5 au. To determine the habitability of the synthetic moons, we calculated the stellar irradiation and tidal heating flux on these moons based on their orbital and physical parameters. The individual moon mass is found to be higher when the host planet orbits at a smaller stellar distance. However, moons leave the circumplanetary disk due to the stellar thief effect, which is stronger closer to the star. We find that 32% of synthetic moons can be habitable in the circumstellar habitable zone. Due to the intense tidal heating, the incidence rate of moon habitability is similar at 2 au, and decreasing to 1% at larger distances (<5 au). We conclude that the circumstellar habitable zone can be extended to moons around giant planets.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18143v1" target="_blank">Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge   Theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prithvi Raj Datla, Luheng Zhao, Wen Wei Ho, Natalie Klco, Huanqian Loh</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18141v1" target="_blank">INN-FF: A Scalable and Efficient Machine Learning Potential for   Molecular Dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taskin Mehereen, Sourav Saha, Intesar Jawad Jaigirdar, Chanwook Park</p>
            <p>The ability to accurately model interatomic interactions in large-scale systems is fundamental to understanding a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena, from drug-protein binding to the behavior of next-generation materials. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have made it possible to achieve ab initio-level accuracy at significantly reduced computational cost, they still require very large training datasets and incur substantial training time and expense. In this work, we propose the Interpolating Neural Network Force Field (INN-FF), a novel framework that merges interpolation theory and tensor decomposition with neural network architectures to efficiently construct molecular dynamics potentials from limited quantum mechanical data. Interpolating Neural Networks (INNs) achieve comparable or better accuracy than traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. On benchmark datasets such as liquid water and rMD17, INN-FF not only matches but often surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy by an order of magnitude, while achieving significantly lower error when trained on smaller datasets. These results suggest that INN-FF offers a promising path toward building efficient and scalable machine-learned force fields.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18138v1" target="_blank">Near-SUSY to Non-SUSY Crossover</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Kondo, Hitoshi Murayama, Bea Noether</p>
            <p>Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation when the size of SUSY breaking is much smaller than the dynamical scale ($m \ll \Lambda$). We show empirical evidence that the near-SUSY limit is continuously connected to the non-SUSY limit ($m \gg \Lambda$) in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental representation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N_f/N_c \gtrsim O(1)$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01348v2" target="_blank">Search for charged Higgs bosons through vector-like top quark pair   production at the LHC</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdesslam Arhrib, Rachid Benbrik, Mbark Berrouj, Mohammed Boukidi, Bouzid Manaut</p>
            <p>We investigate the discovery prospects for a vector-like top partner (VLT) in the Type-II Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-II) extended by a vector-like quark doublet ($TB$) at the 14~TeV LHC. The study focuses on the pair production process $pp \to T\bar{T} \to bH^+\, \bar{b}H^- \to b(tb)\, \bar{b}(\bar{t}b)$, yielding fully hadronic final states characterized by high $b$-jet multiplicity. Two analysis strategies are employed, requiring at least four or five $b$-tagged jets (4$b$ and 5$b$), to exploit the signal topology. Assuming a charged Higgs mass of $m_{H^\pm} \sim 600$~GeV and a systematic uncertainty of $\delta = 5\%$, the 4$b$ channel enables discovery up to $m_T \sim 1200$~GeV at $\mathcal{L} = 300~\text{fb}^{-1}$, while the 5$b$ analysis extends the reach to $m_T \sim 1300$~GeV. At higher luminosities of 1000--3000~fb$^{-1}$, the 5$b$ strategy achieves discovery sensitivity up to $m_T \sim 1400$~GeV. The reach is significantly reduced as $m_{H^\pm}$ increases, due to the suppression of the $\text{BR}(T \to H^+ b)$: for $m_{H^\pm} \sim 1000$~GeV, discovery becomes unattainable across all luminosity and systematic uncertainty configurations. Sensitivity is also strongly impacted by systematic uncertainties: for $\delta = 10\%$ and $m_{H^\pm} < 1000$~GeV, discovery remains viable up to $m_T \sim 1200$~GeV in the 5$b$ analysis, while for $\delta = 20\%$, no discovery is achievable for $m_T \geq 1000$~GeV.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18133v2" target="_blank">Joint Encryption and Error Correction for Secure Quantum Communication</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitin Jha, Abhishek Parakh, Mahadevan Subramaniam</p>
            <p>Secure quantum networks are a bedrock requirement for developing a future quantum internet. However, quantum channels are susceptible to channel noise that introduce errors in the transmitted data. The traditional approach to providing error correction typically encapsulates the message in an error correction code after encryption. Such separate processes incur overhead that must be avoided when possible. We, consequently, provide a single integrated process that allows for encryption as well as error correction. This is a first attempt to do so for secure quantum communication and combines the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the three-stage secure quantum communication protocol. Lastly, it allows for arbitrary qubits to be transmitted from sender to receiver making the proposed protocol general purpose.</p>
