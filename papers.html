            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02829v1" target="_blank">Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of   vacuum decay</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander C. Jenkins, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen</p>
            <p>The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02824v1" target="_blank">Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation   skin effects</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xin Zhong, Bitan Roy, Yun Jing</p>
            <p>The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02822v1" target="_blank">Do Two AI Scientists Agree?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinghong Fu, Ziming Liu, Max Tegmark</p>
            <p>When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the same theory or two different theories? Throughout history of science, we have witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking, but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02820v1" target="_blank">Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Alikhanov</p>
            <p>The $s$-channel process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$(on-shell) is now referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino events such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous confirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its experimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This article suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question $-$ namely, that the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring as $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^-\rho(770)^+$. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\rho^+$ from the initial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\bar\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, $\nu_e e^+\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^+\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons are also possible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory conditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02815v1" target="_blank">Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the   many-body localised phase</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ratul Thakur, Bikram Pain, Sthitadhi Roy</p>
            <p>We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02811v1" target="_blank">An Assessment of the CO$_2$ Emission Reduction Potential of Residential   Load Management in Developing and Developed Countries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alona Zharova, Felix Creutzig</p>
            <p>Intermittent renewable energies are increasingly dominating electricity grids and are forecasted to be the main force driving out fossil fuels from the grid in most major economies until 2040. However, grids based on intermittent renewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of sun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric two and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to adjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to steer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here, we systematically review the literature estimating CO$_2$ savings from residential load management in developing and developed nations. We find that load management holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix (including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and the regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest a mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant with higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are high. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with climate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically feasible. We summarize key regulatory steps to facilitate load management in economies and to realize relevant consumer surplus and mitigation potential.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22444v2" target="_blank">Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengsong Zhang, Heng Zhang, Huazhe Xu, Renjun Xu, Zhenting Wang, Cong Wang, Animesh Garg, Zhibin Li, Arash Ajoudani, Xinyu Liu</p>
            <p>Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage -- spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both physical and intellectual frontiers.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10767v2" target="_blank">Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moiré   superlattices of 2D semiconductors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Ren Fan, Tixuan Tan, Chengxin Xiao, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moir\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moir\'e carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\'e system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00118v2" target="_blank">Novel $|V_{cb}|$ extraction method via boosted $bc$-tagging with in-situ   calibration</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhe Zhao, Congqiao Li, Antonios Agapitos, Dawei Fu, Leyun Gao, Yajun Mao, Qiang Li</p>
            <p>We present a novel method for measuring $|V_{cb}|$ at the LHC using an advanced boosted-jet tagger to identify "$bc$ signatures". By associating boosted $W \rightarrow bc$ signals with $bc$-matched jets from top-quark decays, we enable an in-situ calibration of the tagger. This approach significantly suppresses backgrounds while reducing uncertainties in flavor tagging efficiencies -- key to improving measurement precision. Our study is enabled by the development of realistic, AI-based large- and small-radius taggers, Sophon and the newly introduced SophonAK4, validated to match ATLAS and CMS's state-of-the-art taggers. The method complements the conventional small radius jet approach and enables a ~30% improvement in $|V_{cb}|$ precision under HL-LHC projections. As a byproduct, it enhances $H^{\pm} \rightarrow bc$ search sensitivity by a factor of 2--5 over the recent ATLAS result based on Run 2 data. Our work offers a new perspective for the precision $|V_{cb}|$ measurement and highlights the potential of using advanced tagging models to probe unexplored boosted regimes at the LHC.</p>
