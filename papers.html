            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12153v1" target="_blank">Gravitational waves from the Axiverse</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Das, Francesc Ferrer</p>
            <p>Models with axion like particles (ALPs) often predict the formation of a string-domain wall network in the early universe. We study how such networks of defects appear in the context of string theory, and discuss the conditions for their long-term stability. In a scenario with several axions, we show how a bias term in the potential arises naturally from the effects of multiple instantons, leading to the eventual decay of the domain walls. We find that the annihilation of the network leads to the generation of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with a spectrum that has characteristic contributions from both walls and strings. The unique shape of the spectrum provides an opportunity to probe string theory axions at existing and upcoming observatories. The extinction of the network is also accompanied by the production of different axion mass eigenstates. In a region of the parameter space, the lightest eigenstate can be long lived and make up the dark matter in the universe.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12147v1" target="_blank">Learning Smooth and Expressive Interatomic Potentials for Physical   Property Prediction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Fu, Brandon M. Wood, Luis Barroso-Luque, Daniel S. Levine, Meng Gao, Misko Dzamba, C. Lawrence Zitnick</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating quantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks, including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12142v1" target="_blank">pylevin: efficient numerical integration of integrals containing up to   three Bessel functions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Reischke</p>
            <p>Integrals involving highly oscillatory Bessel functions are notoriously challenging to compute using conventional integration techniques. While several methods are available, they predominantly cater to integrals with at most a single Bessel function, resulting in specialised yet highly optimised solutions. Here we present pylevin, a Python package to efficiently compute integrals containing up to three Bessel functions of arbitrary order and arguments. The implementation makes use of Levin's method and allows for accurate and fast integration of these highly oscillatory integrals. In benchmarking pylevin against existing software for single Bessel function integrals, we find its speed comparable, usually within a factor of two, to specialised packages such as FFTLog. Furthermore, when dealing with integrals containing two or three Bessel functions, pylevin delivers performance up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard adaptive quadrature methods, while also exhibiting better stability for large Bessel function arguments. pylevin is available from source via github or directly from PyPi.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12133v1" target="_blank">Exact colour evolution for jet observables</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey R. Forshaw, Simon Plätzer, Fernando Torre González</p>
            <p>We perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of sub-leading colour corrections in perturbative QCD processes involving multiple soft gluon emissions. This necessitates going beyond the standard parton shower paradigm in order to incorporate interference effects and is accomplished using the CVolver program, which simulates parton showers at the amplitude level. We can compute cross-sections with full-colour precision and also broken down explicitly in terms of their $N_c$ dependence. In this paper, we focus on the jet cross-section with a veto of additional jets in some fixed region of phase-space, since this is sensitive to wide-angle, soft gluon radiation. We consider $Z \to q \bar{q}$, $H \to gg$, $q\bar{q} \to q\bar{q}$, $qg \to qg$, $gg \to gg$ and $ZZ \to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}$. We find that non-trivial sub-leading colour effects are generally important at the 5 -- 30\% level and much more than this for certain interference contributions. Remarkably, for this observable, we find that for all of the $t$-channel gluon exchange processes that we consider, the strictly leading colour approximation, which includes the replacement $C_F \to C_A/2$, is an excellent approximation to the full colour result (up to an overall colour factor).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12132v1" target="_blank">Electrically tunable strong coupling in a hybrid-2D excitonic   metasurface for optical modulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Hoekstra, Jorik van de Groep</p>
            <p>Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the exciton\`s nonradiative decay rate. These results highlight how hybrid-2D excitonic metasurfaces offer novel opportunities to realize nanophotonic devices for active wavefront manipulation and optical communication.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12129v1" target="_blank">When Wyner and Ziv Met Bayes in Quantum-Classical Realm</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Aamir Sohail, Touheed Anwar Atif, S. Sandeep Pradhan</p>
            <p>In this work, we address the lossy quantum-classical source coding with the quantum side-information (QC-QSI) problem. The task is to compress the classical information about a quantum source, obtained after performing a measurement while incurring a bounded reconstruction error. Here, the decoder is allowed to use the side information to recover the classical data obtained from measurements on the source states. We introduce a new formulation based on a backward (posterior) channel, replacing the single-letter distortion observable with a single-letter posterior channel to capture reconstruction error. Unlike the rate-distortion framework, this formulation imposes a block error constraint. An analogous formulation is developed for lossy classical source coding with classical side information (C-CSI) problem. We derive an inner bound on the asymptotic performance limit in terms of single-letter quantum and classical mutual information quantities of the given posterior channel for QC-QSI and C-CSI cases, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a connection between rate-distortion and rate-channel theory, showing that a rate-channel compression protocol attains the optimal rate-distortion function for a specific distortion measure and level.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12127v1" target="_blank">Multipoint conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Part I: Bipartite   Mellin-Barnes representation and reconstruction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. B. Alkalaev, Semyon Mandrygin</p>
            <p>We propose a systematic approach to calculating $n$-point one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions which we call the reconstruction procedure. It relies on decomposing a conformal integral over basis functions which are generated from a set of master functions by acting with the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In order to identify the master functions we introduce a bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation by means of splitting a given conformal integral into two additive parts, one of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series.   For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable part of the bipartite representation contains all master functions. In particular, this allows us to evaluate the parametric pentagon integral as a sum of ten basis functions generated from two master functions by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_5$. The resulting expression can be tested in two ways. First, when one of propagator powers is set to zero, the pentagon integral is reduced to the known box integral, which is also rederived through the reconstruction procedure. Second, going to the non-parametric case, we reproduce the known expression for the pentagon integral given in terms of logarithms derived earlier within the geometric approach to calculating conformal integrals.   We conclude by considering the hexagon integral ($n=6$) for which we show that those basis functions which follow from the computable part of the bipartite representation are not enough and more basis functions are required. In the second part of our project we will describe a method of constructing a complete set of master/basis functions in the $n$-point case.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12126v1" target="_blank">Real operator systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David P. Blecher, Travis B. Russell</p>
            <p>Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. For example in the final two sections of our paper we study real versions of the Kirchberg conjectures etc, and show that they are equivalent. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12121v1" target="_blank">Topology from Nothing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12112v1" target="_blank">The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon   curvature perturbations at one loop</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Inomata</p>
            <p>Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</p>
