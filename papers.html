            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08646v1" target="_blank">Poly-Autoregressive Prediction for Modeling Interactions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neerja Thakkar, Tara Sadjadpour, Jathushan Rajasegaran, Shiry Ginosar, Jitendra Malik</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple framework for predicting the behavior of an agent in multi-agent settings. In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios. The project website can be found at https://neerja.me/PAR/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08645v1" target="_blank">Re$^3$Sim: Generating High-Fidelity Simulation Data via   3D-Photorealistic Real-to-Sim for Robotic Manipulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoshen Han, Minghuan Liu, Yilun Chen, Junqiu Yu, Xiaoyang Lyu, Yang Tian, Bolun Wang, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
            <p>Real-world data collection for robotics is costly and resource-intensive, requiring skilled operators and expensive hardware. Simulations offer a scalable alternative but often fail to achieve sim-to-real generalization due to geometric and visual gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D-photorealistic real-to-sim system, namely, RE$^3$SIM, addressing geometric and visual sim-to-real gaps. RE$^3$SIM employs advanced 3D reconstruction and neural rendering techniques to faithfully recreate real-world scenarios, enabling real-time rendering of simulated cross-view cameras within a physics-based simulator. By utilizing privileged information to collect expert demonstrations efficiently in simulation, and train robot policies with imitation learning, we validate the effectiveness of the real-to-sim-to-real pipeline across various manipulation task scenarios. Notably, with only simulated data, we can achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with an average success rate exceeding 58%. To push the limit of real-to-sim, we further generate a large-scale simulation dataset, demonstrating how a robust policy can be built from simulation data that generalizes across various objects. Codes and demos are available at: http://xshenhan.github.io/Re3Sim/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08644v1" target="_blank">Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and   learning in neural networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoony Kang, Wolfgang Losert</p>
            <p>The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08641v1" target="_blank">Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated   single band for matrix models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanwen Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstruction is absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalization. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11773v2" target="_blank">Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael C. Ogilvie, Moses A. Schindler, Stella T. Schindler</p>
            <p>Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08635v1" target="_blank">Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. A. Stepanov, S. Iskakov, M. I. Katsnelson, A. I. Lichtenstein</p>
            <p>We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11714v4" target="_blank">Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei Katsevich, Igor R. Klebanov, Zimo Sun</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</p>

            <p>We present an inclusive search for anomalous production of single-photon events from neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE experiment. The search and its signal definition are motivated by the previous observation of a low-energy excess of electromagnetic shower events from the MiniBooNE experiment. We use the Wire-Cell reconstruction framework to select a sample of inclusive single-photon final-state interactions with a final efficiency and purity of 7.0% and 40.2%, respectively. We leverage simultaneous measurements of sidebands of charged current $\nu_{\mu}$ interactions and neutral current interactions producing $\pi^{0}$ mesons to constrain signal and background predictions and reduce uncertainties. We perform a blind analysis using a dataset collected from February 2016 to July 2018, corresponding to an exposure of $6.34\times10^{20}$ protons on target from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. In the full signal region, we observe agreement between the data and the prediction, with a goodness-of-fit $p$-value of 0.11. We then isolate a sub-sample of these events containing no visible protons, and observe $93\pm22\text{(stat.)}\pm35\text{(syst.)}$ data events above prediction, corresponding to just above $2\sigma$ local significance, concentrated at shower energies below 600 MeV.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08617v1" target="_blank">Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Orientations with Complex X-ray Magnetic   Linear Dichroism</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Raboni Ferreira, Benedikt J. Daurer, Jeffrey Neethirajan, Andreas Apseros, Sandra Ruiz-Gómez, Burkhard Kaulich, Majid Kazemian, Claire Donnelly</p>
            <p>Compensated magnets are of increasing interest for both fundamental research and applications, with their net-zero magnetization leading to ultrafast dynamics and robust order. To understand and control this order, nanoscale mapping of local domain structures is necessary. One of the main routes to mapping antiferromagnetic order is X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD), which probes the local orientation of the N\'eel vector. However, XMLD imaging typically suffers from weak contrast and has mainly been limited to surface-sensitive techniques. Here, we harness coherent diffractive imaging to map the complex XMLD spectroscopically, and identify the phase linear dichroism as a high-contrast, high-resolution mechanism for imaging magnetic order. By applying X-ray spectroptychography to a model sample, we retrieve the full complex XMLD spectrum. Combining this with hierarchical clustering, we resolve the spatial distribution of probed domains by their distinct spectral signatures, providing a robust method for analyzing magnetic configurations with weak signals. Our results show that phase contrast is significantly stronger than the corresponding absorption contrast, offering higher spatial-resolution magnetic imaging. This approach establishes a reliable, element- and orbital-sensitive tool for studying compensated magnets.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14175v2" target="_blank">Wakefield regeneration in a resonantly driven plasma accelerator</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John P. Farmer, Giovanni Zevi Della Porta</p>
            <p>Plasma wakefields offer high acceleration gradients, orders of magnitude larger than conventional RF accelerators. However, the achievable luminosity remains relatively low, typically limited by repetition rate and the charge accelerated per shot. In this work, we show that a train of drive bunches can be harnessed to accelerate multiple witness bunches in a single shot. We demonstrate that periodically loading the wakefields removes the limit on the energy transfer from the drive beam to the plasma, which allows the luminosity to be increased. Proof-of-concept simulations for the AWAKE scheme are carried out to demonstrate the technique, achieving a doubling of the accelerated charge while exploiting only a fraction of the drive train.</p>
