            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11501v1" target="_blank">Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak   spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Sá, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11499v1" target="_blank">Gauged $τ$-lepton chiral currents and $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Di Luzio, Marco Nardecchia, Claudio Toni</p>
            <p>We consider a class of theories with a $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry associated with leptonic chiral currents. The low-energy effective field theory includes a light spin-$1$ boson coupled to the electroweak gauge sector via a Wess-Zumino term, which ensures anomaly cancellation in the infrared. As a concrete application, we show that a light vector boson with mass $m_X \simeq 2.1\,\text{GeV}$, coupled to a $\tau$-lepton chiral current, can readily account for the recent $3\sigma$ excess observed in $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ at Belle II, while remaining consistent with existing constraints from $Z \to \gamma E_{\rm miss}$ and direct searches for anomalon fields responsible for anomaly cancellation in the ultraviolet. After classifying phenomenologically viable models, we explore in greater detail two concrete realizations which give rise to distinctive phenomenological signatures, potentially accessible at future experiments at the high-energy and intensity frontiers.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06369v2" target="_blank">Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erick Arguello Cruz, Igor R. Klebanov, Grigory Tarnopolsky, Yuan Xin</p>
            <p>The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d<6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalization, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11492v1" target="_blank">Anomalies in Hadronic $B$ Decays: an Update</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhubanjyoti Bhattacharya, Marianne Bouchard, Luke Hudy, Alexandre Jean, David London, Christopher MacKenzie</p>
            <p>Recently, $B\to PP$ decays ($B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$, $P = \{ \pi, K \}$) were analyzed under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry (SU(3)$_F$). Although the individual fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays are good, it was found that the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. In this paper, we extend this analysis to include decays in which there is an $\eta$ and/or $\eta'$ meson in the final state. We now find that the combined fit exhibits a $4.1\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$, and 1000% SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects are still required to explain the data. These results are rigorous, group-theoretically -- no theoretical assumptions have been made. But when one adds some theoretical input motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.9\sigma$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11491v1" target="_blank">Potential failures of physics-informed machine learning in traffic flow   modeling: theoretical and experimental analysis</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Zheng Lei, Yaobang Gong, Dianwei Chen, Yao Cheng, Xianfeng Terry Yang</p>
            <p>This study critically examines the performance of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approaches for traffic flow modeling, defining the failure of a PIML model as the scenario where it underperforms both its purely data-driven and purely physics-based counterparts. We analyze the loss landscape by perturbing trained models along the principal eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix and evaluating corresponding loss values. Our results suggest that physics residuals in PIML do not inherently hinder optimization, contrary to a commonly assumed failure cause. Instead, successful parameter updates require both ML and physics gradients to form acute angles with the quasi-true gradient and lie within a conical region. Given inaccuracies in both the physics models and the training data, satisfying this condition is often difficult. Experiments reveal that physical residuals can degrade the performance of LWR- and ARZ-based PIML models, especially under highly physics-driven settings. Moreover, sparse sampling and the use of temporally averaged traffic data can produce misleadingly small physics residuals that fail to capture actual physical dynamics, contributing to model failure. We also identify the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition as a key indicator of dataset suitability for PIML, where successful applications consistently adhere to this criterion. Lastly, we observe that higher-order models like ARZ tend to have larger error lower bounds than lower-order models like LWR, which is consistent with the experimental findings of existing studies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14971v4" target="_blank">Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to   equidistribution of probabilities of microstates</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. P. Meilakhs</p>
            <p>We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems, such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus, we present a possible solution to the famous arrow-of-time problem.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11489v1" target="_blank">Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Bertini, Pieter W. Claeys, Tomaž Prosen</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11488v1" target="_blank">Higher-spin effects in black hole and neutron star binary dynamics:   worldline supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Bonocore, Anna Kulesza, Johannes Pirsch</p>
            <p>The inclusion of spin effects in the binary dynamics for black hole and neutron stars is crucial for the computation of gravitational wave observables. Worldline supersymmetric models have shown to be particularly efficient at this task up to quadratic order in spin, but progress at higher orders has been hampered by no-go-theorems. In this work we propose a novel approach to overcome this problem by extending the supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing an all-order in spin and linear in curvature, manifestly supersymmetric Hamiltonian, as well as a cubic order in spin Hamiltonian in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. In doing so, we identify a criterion that uniquely determines the Kerr geometry in terms of worldline supersymmetry. Equipped with these Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the exponentiation of three-point and Compton amplitudes using the recently proposed Generalized Wilson line approach.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11487v1" target="_blank">Area and volume from entangled qubits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan M. Romero, Emiliano Montoya-González</p>
            <p>In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelogram is derived from entangled 6-qubit states. Moreover, the volume of a 3D parallelepiped is deduced from an entangled 9-qubit state. Furthermore, it has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. It is worth mentioning that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11486v1" target="_blank">Unbiased observable estimation via noisy channel mixtures for   fault-tolerant quantum computation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitrii Khitrin, Kenneth R. Brown, Abhinav Anand</p>
            <p>Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.</p>
