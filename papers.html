            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04726v1" target="_blank">Double Narrow-Line Signatures of Dark Matter Decay and New Constraints   from XRISM Observations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Yin, Yutaka Fujita, Yuichiro Ezoe, Yoshitaka Ishisaki</p>
            <p>We investigate the indirect detection search of the two-body decay of dark matter particles into final states containing a photon, a process predicted in various promising dark matter models such as axion-like particles and sterile neutrinos. Recent and near-future photon detectors with a resolution $ R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda = O(1000) $ are primarily optimized for the velocity dispersion of dark matter in the Milky Way. When performing indirect detection of dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into account the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark matter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak structure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial velocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this two-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the Centaurus galaxy cluster~\cite{XRISM:2025axf}. Although, due to the relatively short observation time, our derived limit is weaker than some existing limits, among dark matter searches in galaxy clusters our limit is one of the most stringent (at least in certain mass ranges). We also perform the usual single-peak analysis, for considering the various scenarios, that prefer narrow-line photon from the faraway galaxy cluster. Future data releases from XRISM as well as other observatories will further strengthen our conclusions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04720v1" target="_blank">FluidNexus: 3D Fluid Reconstruction and Prediction from a Single Video</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Gao, Hong-Xing Yu, Bo Zhu, Jiajun Wu</p>
            <p>We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video. Project website: https://yuegao.me/FluidNexus.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04716v1" target="_blank">Optimal Cell Shape for Accurate Chemical Gradient Sensing in Eukaryote   Chemotaxis</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiqiu Mou, Yuansheng Cao</p>
            <p>Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy environments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing accuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell shape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a concave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient detection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or contractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost of increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation cost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in shallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a cell should adopt a repeating "run-and-expansion" cycle. Our theoretical predictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast amoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This study highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in facilitating accurate chemotaxis.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04711v1" target="_blank">Ultrahigh free-electron Kerr nonlinearity in all-semiconductor   waveguides for all-optical nonlinear modulation of mid-infrared light</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonzalo Álvarez-Pérez, Huatian Hu, Fangcheng Huang, Tadele Orbula Otomalo, Michele Ortolani, Cristian Ciracì</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optical waveguides, particularly those harnessing the optical Kerr effect, are promising for advancing next-generation photonic technologies. Despite the Kerr effect`s ultrafast response, its inherently weak nonlinearity has hindered practical applications. Here, we explore free-electron-induced Kerr nonlinearities in all-semiconductor waveguides, revealing that longitudinal bulk plasmons (inherently nonlocal excitations) can generate exceptionally strong Kerr nonlinearities. We specifically develop a nonlinear eigenmode analysis integrated with semiclassical hydrodynamic theory to compute the linear and nonlinear optical responses originating from the quantum behavior of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors. These waveguides achieve ultrahigh nonlinear coefficients exceeding 10$^7$ W$^{-1}$km$^{-1}$ and support long-propagating modes with propagation distances over 100 $\mu$m. Additionally, we confirm the robustness of the nonlinear response under realistic conditions by considering viscoelastic and nonlinear damping mechanisms. Finally, we implement our all-semiconductor waveguides in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, demonstrating efficient nonlinear modulation of the transmittance spectrum via the free-electron Kerr effect. This work evidences the transformative potential of free-electron nonlinearities in heavily doped semiconductors for photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for scalable on-chip nonlinear nanophotonic systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04705v1" target="_blank">One Extension to Explain Them All, One Parameter to Minimize $χ^2$,   One Framework to Bring Them All, and in One Model Bind Them</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Forconi, Eleonora DI Valentino</p>
            <p>The increasing precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations has unveiled significant tensions between different datasets, notably between Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), as well as with the late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this work, we explore a variety of $\Lambda$CDM extensions to assess their ability to reconcile these discrepancies. The statistical preference for these extensions remains moderate, and imposing $n_s=1$ often worsens model performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of incremental modifications to $\Lambda$CDM and suggest that either more complex new physics or, more likely, improved systematic understanding in the CMB sector may be required to fully address the observed tensions. While CMB experiments are often considered the gold standard of precision cosmology, our results reinforce that these measurements are not immune to systematic uncertainties, which may be underestimated in current analyses.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15037v4" target="_blank">DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling   Furcated DLOs in Real-Time</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Chen, Xiaoyue Wu, Yeheng Zong, Anran Li, Yuzhen Chen, Julie Wu, Bohao Zhang, Ram Vasudevan</p>
            <p>Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04702v1" target="_blank">Scalable and Site-Specific Frequency Tuning of Two-Level System Defects   in Superconducting Qubit Arrays</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Larry Chen, Kan-Heng Lee, Chuan-Hong Liu, Brian Marinelli, Ravi K. Naik, Ziqi Kang, Noah Goss, Hyunseong Kim, David I. Santiago, Irfan Siddiqi</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors containing tens to hundreds of qubits have demonstrated the building blocks for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Nonetheless, a fundamental barrier to scaling further is the prevalence of fluctuating quantum two-level system (TLS) defects that can couple resonantly to qubits, causing excess decoherence and enhanced gate errors. Here we introduce a scalable architecture for site-specific and in-situ manipulation of TLS frequencies out of the spectral vicinity of our qubits. Our method is resource efficient, combining TLS frequency tuning and universal single qubit control into a single on-chip control line per qubit. We independently control each qubit's dissipative environment to dynamically improve both qubit coherence times and single qubit gate fidelities -- with a constant time overhead that does not scale with the device size. Over a period of 40 hours across 6 qubits, we demonstrate a $36\%$ improvement in average single qubit error rates and a $17\%$ improvement in average energy relaxation times. Critically, we realize a 4-fold suppression in the occurrence of TLS-induced performance outliers, and a complete reduction of simultaneous outlier events. These results mark a significant step toward overcoming the challenges that TLS defects pose to scaling superconducting quantum processors.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00251v2" target="_blank">High Energy Particle Detection with Large Area Superconducting Microwire   Array</a></h3>

            <p>We present the first detailed study of an 8-channel $2\times2$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV proton beam and 8 GeV electron and pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The SMSPD detection efficiency was measured for the first time for protons, electrons, and pions, enabled by the use of a silicon tracking telescope that provided precise spatial resolution of 30 $\mu$m for 120 GeV protons and 130 $\mu$m for 8 GeV electrons and pions. The result demonstrated consistent detection efficiency across pixels and at different bias currents. Time resolution of 1.15 ns was measured for the first time for SMSPD with proton, electron, and pions, enabled by the use of an MCP-PMT which provided a ps-level reference time stamp. The results presented is the first step towards developing SMSPD array systems optimized for high energy particle detection and identification for future accelerator-based experiments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04699v1" target="_blank">Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum LDPC   Codes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keyang Chen, Yuanting Liu, Yiming Zhang, Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen, Ke Liu, Hao Song</p>
            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes present a promising route to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet systematic strategies for their exploration remain underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. Besides providing efficient characterizations for demonstrations using Gr\"obner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem, allowing us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choice of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their inherent link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and offer an efficient method for searching for finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced mathematical structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Nadeem, Walter Wilcox, Frank X. Lee</p>
            <p>We study the electric polarizability of a charged kaon from four-point functions in lattice QCD as an alternative to the background field method. Lattice four-point correlation functions are constructed from quark and gluon fields to be used in Monte Carlo simulations. The elastic form factor (charge radius) is needed in the method which can be obtained from the same four-point functions at large current separations. Preliminary results from the connected quark-line diagrams are presented.</p>
