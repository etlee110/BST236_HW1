            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24865v1" target="_blank">Quantum Acoustics with Tunable Nonlinearity in the Superstrong Coupling   Regime</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Scigliuzzo, Léo Peyruchat, Riccardo Maria Marabini, Carla Becker, Vincent Jouanny, Per Delsing, Pasquale Scarlino</p>
            <p>Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning. These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24854v1" target="_blank">Practical primary thermometry via alkali-metal-vapour Doppler broadening</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicola Agnew, Veronika Vohníková, Erling Riis, Graham Machin, Aidan S. Arnold</p>
            <p>Doppler-broadening thermometry (DBT) can be used as a calibration-free primary reference suitable for practical applications, e.g. reliably measuring temperatures over long periods of time in environments where sensor retrieval is impractical. We report on our proof-of-concept investigations into DBT with alkali metal vapour cells, with a particular focus on both absorption and frequency accuracy during scans. We reach sub-kelvin temperature accuracy, and experimental absorption fit residuals below $0.05\,\%$, in a simple setup. The outlook for portable, practical devices is bright, with clear prospects for future improvement.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21924v2" target="_blank">Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material   Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamyar Rashidi, Matthew Y. Sfeir</p>
            <p>Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24851v1" target="_blank">Realistic quantum network simulation for experimental BBM92 key   distribution</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michelle Chalupnik, Brian Doolittle, Suparna Seshadri, Eric G. Brown, Keith Kenemer, Daniel Winton, Daniel Sanchez-Rosales, Matthew Skrzypczyk, Cara Alexander, Eric Ostby, Michael Cubeddu</p>
            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.</p>

            <p>In July 2024, Sunrise completed its third successful science flight. The Sunrise III observatory had been upgraded significantly after the two previous successful flights in 2009 and 2013. Three completely new instruments focus on the small-scale physical processes and their complex interaction from the deepest observable layers in the photosphere up to chromospheric heights. Previously poorly explored spectral regions and lines are exploited to paint a three-dimensional picture of the solar atmosphere with unprecedented completeness and level of detail. The full polarimetric information is captured by all three instruments to reveal the interaction between the magnetic fields and the hydrodynamic processes. Two slit-based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched successfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna (Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give an overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24849v1" target="_blank">Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near   interpolation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Minh-Toan Nguyen, Mauro Pastore, Rudy Skerk</p>
            <p>For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24847v1" target="_blank">Nematicity in iron pnictides: phase competition and emergent symmetry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiming Wang, Changle Liu, Shan Wu, Jianda Wu, Qimiao Si, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>The phase diagram of iron-based superconductors contains a host of electronic orders, which are intimately connected with their superconductivity. Here we analyze the fluctuations of one type of nematic order in another. Our analysis leads to an emergent U(1) symmetry at a first-order transition between a nematic phase and a $C_4$-symmetric charge-ordered phase. We characterize the continuous symmetry in terms of a certain hidden Lie algebra that links the different orders. This emergent symmetry leads to a Goldstone mode at the transition and causes softening of excitations in the nematic and charge sectors near the transition. The underlying physics bears a resemblance to the anisotropic XZ spin model, with the nematic order and charge $C_4$ order parameters playing the roles of the $x$ and $z$ components of the magnetization vector, respectively. We provide the experimental evidence in support of the proposed effects, and discuss the general implications of our results for the physics of iron-based superconductors and other correlated systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00459v2" target="_blank">Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase   Probability Distributions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew S. Perley, Todd P. Coleman</p>
            <p>Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24845v1" target="_blank">A Planar Huygens Antenna Utilizing Crossed Electric and Magnetic Dipoles</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Rizwan Akram, Abbas Semnani</p>
            <p>The natural source of a magnetic dipole in antennas is typically an electrically small loop, which can be utilized in conjunction with an electric dipole to realize an electrically small Huygens' antenna. However, these antennas suffer from low radiation efficiency and their theoretical directivity limit is 4.8 dBi. Magnetic dipoles with an electrical size larger than 0.5lambda are highly desirable for high-gain applications. This paper builds on the development of a magnetic dipole source that utilizes a 0.5lambda slot positioned near a printed dipole with a length twice that of the slot. Such a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles yields a highly directive radiation pattern, resulting in a higher gain than a uniformly illuminated antenna of similar size. The prototype is designed to operate at 4.5 GHz, with a directivity of up to 8.37 dBi. The analytical, numerical, and measured results agree fully. This high-gain superdirective antenna is highly desirable due to its excellent features, including being low-profile, PCB compatible, and having a low-complexity feeding topology, compared to the existing approach of the two-element end-fire array.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24839v1" target="_blank">Novel methodology to obtain transonic solutions for dissipative flows   around compact objects</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shilpa Sarkar</p>
            <p>A novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions around compact objects is reported here. A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.</p>
