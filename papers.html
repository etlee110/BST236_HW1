            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07628v2" target="_blank">Probing New Physics with the Electron Yukawa coupling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Anna Erdelyi, Ramona Gröber, Nudzeim Selimovic</p>
            <p>A dedicated run of a future electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) at a center-of-mass energy equal to the Higgs boson mass would enable a direct measurement of the electron Yukawa coupling. However, it poses substantial experimental difficulties due to large backgrounds, the requirement for monochromatised $e^+e^-$ beams, and the potential extension of the FCC-ee timeline. Given this, we explore the extent to which the electron Yukawa coupling can be enhanced in simplified UV models and examine whether such scenarios can be constrained by other FCC-ee runs or upcoming experiments at the intensity frontier. Our results indicate that in certain classes of models, the $(g-2)_e$ provides a probe of the electron Yukawa coupling that is as effective or better than the FCC-ee. Nevertheless, there exist models that can lead to sizeable deviations in the electron Yukawa coupling which can only be probed in a dedicated run at the Higgs pole mass.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09652v2" target="_blank">Probing Millicharged Particles at an Electron Beam Dump with   Ultralow-Threshold Sensors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rouven Essig, Peiran Li, Zhen Liu, Megan McDuffie, Ryan Plestid, Hailin Xu</p>
            <p>We propose to search for millicharged particles produced in high-intensity electron beam dumps using small ultralow-threshold sensors. As a concrete example, we consider a Skipper-CCD placed behind the beam dump in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. We compute the millicharged particle flux, including both electromagnetic cascade and meson productions emanating from an aluminum target. We find that the sensitivity of a modest 2x14 array of Skipper-CCDs can exceed the sensitivity of all existing searches for millicharged particle masses below 1.5 GeV, and is either competitive or world leading when compared to other proposed experiments. Our results demonstrate that small-scale ultralow threshold silicon devices can enhance the reach of accelerator-based experiments, while fitting comfortably within existing experimental halls.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23208v2" target="_blank">Kinetix: Investigating the Training of General Agents through Open-Ended   Physics-Based Control Tasks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Matthews, Michael Beukman, Chris Lu, Jakob Foerster</p>
            <p>While large models trained with self-supervised learning on offline datasets have shown remarkable capabilities in text and image domains, achieving the same generalisation for agents that act in sequential decision problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by procedurally generating tens of millions of 2D physics-based tasks and using these to train a general reinforcement learning (RL) agent for physical control. To this end, we introduce Kinetix: an open-ended space of physics-based RL environments that can represent tasks ranging from robotic locomotion and grasping to video games and classic RL environments, all within a unified framework. Kinetix makes use of our novel hardware-accelerated physics engine Jax2D that allows us to cheaply simulate billions of environment steps during training. Our trained agent exhibits strong physical reasoning capabilities in 2D space, being able to zero-shot solve unseen human-designed environments. Furthermore, fine-tuning this general agent on tasks of interest shows significantly stronger performance than training an RL agent *tabula rasa*. This includes solving some environments that standard RL training completely fails at. We believe this demonstrates the feasibility of large scale, mixed-quality pre-training for online RL and we hope that Kinetix will serve as a useful framework to investigate this further.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20944v2" target="_blank">AR You on Track? Investigating Effects of Augmented Reality Anchoring on   Dual-Task Performance While Walking</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Rasch, Matthias Wilhalm, Florian Müller, Francesco Chiossi</p>
            <p>With the increasing spread of AR head-mounted displays suitable for everyday use, interaction with information becomes ubiquitous, even while walking. However, this requires constant shifts of our attention between walking and interacting with virtual information to fulfill both tasks adequately. Accordingly, we as a community need a thorough understanding of the mutual influences of walking and interacting with digital information to design safe yet effective interactions. Thus, we systematically investigate the effects of different AR anchors (hand, head, torso) and task difficulties on user experience and performance. We engage participants (n=26) in a dual-task paradigm involving a visual working memory task while walking. We assess the impact of dual-tasking on both virtual and walking performance, and subjective evaluations of mental and physical load. Our results show that head-anchored AR content least affected walking while allowing for fast and accurate virtual task interaction, while hand-anchored content increased reaction times and workload.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18450v2" target="_blank">Towards quantum error correction with two-body gates for quantum   registers based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Dulog, Martin B. Plenio</p>
            <p>Color centers in diamond provide a possible hardware for quantum computation, where the most basic quantum information processing unit are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, each in contact with adjacent carbon nuclear spins. With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04583v2" target="_blank">Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based   Fabry-Pérot microcavity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jannis Hessenauer, Jonathan Körber, Misagh Ghezellou, Jawad Ul-Hassan, Georgy V. Astakhov, Wolfgang Knolle, Jörg Wrachtrup, David Hunger</p>
            <p>Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07979v4" target="_blank">Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned   discrete axisymmetry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengdi Sun, Ata Shakeri, Arvin Keshvari, Dimitrios Giannakopoulos, Qing Wang, Wei Ting Chen, Steven G. Johnson, Zin Lin</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07810v2" target="_blank">Routing algorithm within the multiple non-overlapping paths approach for   quantum key distribution networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeniy O. Kiktenko, Andrey Tayduganov, Aleksey K. Fedorov</p>
            <p>We develop a novel key routing algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks that utilizes a distribution of keys between remote, i.e., not directly connected by a QKD link, nodes through multiple non-overlapping paths. This approach enchases the security of QKD network by minimizing potential vulnerabilities associated with individual trusted nodes. The algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of the workload across the QKD network links, while aiming for the target key generation rate between directly connected and remote nodes. We present the results of testing the algorithm on two QKD network models consisting of 6 and 10 nodes. The testing demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to distribute secure keys among the nodes of the network in an all-to-all manner, ensuring that the information-theoretic security of the keys between remote nodes is maintained even when one of the trusted nodes is compromised. These results highlight the potential of the algorithm to improve the performance of QKD networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12818v3" target="_blank">Non-magnetic glass-fiber cryostat for MADMAX prototype tests</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Kreikemeyer-Lorenzo, T. Koettig, P. Borges de Sousa, C. Gooch, D. Kittlinger, B. Majorovits, J. P. A. Maldonado, P. Pralavorio</p>
            <p>MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.06 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11902v2" target="_blank">Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and   $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swaraj Pratim Sarmah, Umananda Dev Goswami</p>
            <p>We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</p>
