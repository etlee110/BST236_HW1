            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11648v1" target="_blank">Exploring the Future of Soft X-ray Polarimetry: the Capabilities of the   REDSoX Instrument for XDINS and Magnetar Studies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruth M. E. Kelly, Herman L. Marshall, Silvia Zane, Nabil Brice, Swati Ravi, Roberto Turolla, Roberto Taverna, Denis González-Caniulef</p>
            <p>X-ray polarimetry offers a unique window into neutron star physics and can provide answers to questions that cannot otherwise be probed. The up-and-coming REDSoX sounding rocket mission will be the first experiment equipped with a detector able to explore polarized X-rays below 1 keV, observing in the 0.2-0.4 keV range. Although REDSoX will only be capable of short, one-off observations, it will crucially test the instrument performance. In this paper we investigate how a fully-fledged orbital mission with longer lifetime, based on an instrument design similar to REDSoX, will allow us to study thermal emission from the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) and magnetars, probing their magnetic field and the physics of their outer surface layers, including vacuum effects and QED mode conversion at the vacuum resonance. We discuss the potentially observable features for promising values of the star's surface temperature, magnetic field, and viewing geometry. Assuming emission from the whole surface, we find that, for a source with a magnetic field B=5x10^{13} G and surface temperature T~10^7 K, the instrument can resolve a proton-cyclotron absorption feature in the spectrum with high significance when collecting ~25,000 counts across a single observation. Similarly, for a source with B=10^{14} G and T~10^7 K, a switch in the dominant polarization mode, caused by mode conversion at the vacuum resonance, can be detected by collecting ~25,000 counts, allowing for a long-sought observational test of the presence of QED effects. We then present two case studies for XDINS targets: RX J1856.5-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11645v1" target="_blank">Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range   Forces</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juehang Qin, Dorian W. P. Amaral, Sunil A. Bhave, Erqian Cai, Daniel Carney, Rafael F. Lang, Shengchao Li, Alberto M. Marino, Claire Marvinney, Jared R. Newton, Jacob M. Taylor, Christopher Tunnell</p>
            <p>Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $>70\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01974v2" target="_blank">On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond   rotational invariance</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Justin Ko, Koki Okajima</p>
            <p>Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a \emph{denoising-factorisation transition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole phase diagram when considering finite size effects.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11644v1" target="_blank">The waves-in-space Purcell effect for superconducting qubits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Param Patel, Mingkang Xia, Chao Zhou, Pinlei Lu, Xi Cao, Israa Yusuf, Jacob Repicky, Michael Hatridge</p>
            <p>Quantum information processing, especially with quantum error correction, requires both long-lived qubits and fast, quantum non-demolition readout. In superconducting circuits this leads to the requirement to both strongly couple qubits, such as transmons, to readout modes while also protecting them from associated Purcell decay through the readout port. So-called Purcell filters can provide this protection, at the cost of significant increases in circuit components and complexity. However, as we demonstrate in this work, visualizing the qubit fields in space reveals locations where the qubit fields are strong and cavity fields weak; simply placing ports at these locations provides intrinsic Purcell protection. For a $\lambda/2$ readout mode in the `chip-in-tube' geometry, we show both millisecond level Purcell protection and, conversely, greatly enhanced Purcell decay (qubit lifetime of 1~$\mu$s) simply by relocating the readout port. This method of integrating the Purcell protection into the qubit-cavity geometry can be generalized to other 3D implementations, such as post-cavities, as well as planar geometries. For qubit frequencies below the readout mode this effect is quite distinct from the multi-mode Purcell effect, which we demonstrate in a 3D-post geometry where we show both Purcell protection of the qubit while spoiling the quality factor of higher cavity harmonics to protect against dephasing due to stray photons in these modes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11641v1" target="_blank">Ladder Operator Block-Encoding</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William A. Simon, Carter M. Gustin, Kamil Serafin, Alexis Ralli, Gary R. Goldstein, Peter J. Love</p>
            <p>We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding second-quantized ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic oscillator, and phi4 and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various second-quantized operators as compared to block-encoding frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. The LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open source python package to enable further applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12756v4" target="_blank">Light Dark Matter Search with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamonds</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> So Chigusa, Masashi Hazumi, Ernst David Herbschleb, Norikazu Mizuochi, Kazunori Nakayama</p>
            <p>We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11638v1" target="_blank">Scaling the Automated Discovery of Quantum Circuits via Reinforcement   Learning with Gadgets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Olle, Oleg M. Yevtushenko, Florian Marquardt</p>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as a powerful tool for designing quantum circuits, which are essential for processing quantum information. RL applications have typically focused on circuits of small to intermediate complexity, as computation times tend to increase exponentially with growing circuit complexity. This computational explosion severely limits the scalability of RL and casts significant doubt on its broader applicability. In this paper, we propose a principled approach based on the systematic discovery and introduction of composite gates -- {\it gadgets}, that enables RL scalability, thereby expanding its potential applications. As a case study, we explore the discovery of Clifford encoders for Quantum Error Correction. We demonstrate that incorporating gadgets in the form of composite Clifford gates, in addition to standard CNOT and Hadamard gates, significantly enhances the efficiency of RL agents. Specifically, the computation speed increases (by one or even two orders of magnitude), enabling RL to discover highly complex quantum codes without previous knowledge. We illustrate this advancement with examples of QEC code discovery with parameters $ [[n,1,d]] $ for $ d \leq 7 $ and $ [[n,k,6]] $ for $ k \leq 7 $. We note that the most complicated circuits of these classes were not previously found. We highlight the advantages and limitations of the gadget-based approach. Our method paves the way for scaling the RL-based automatic discovery of complicated quantum circuits for various tasks, which may include designing logical operations between logical qubits or discovering quantum algorithms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11635v1" target="_blank">Sphaleron decay on circles</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Navarro-Obregón, J. Queiruga</p>
            <p>We discuss various sphaleron-like solutions on $\mathbb{S}^1$. These solutions are static, but unstable. We explore possible stabilization mechanisms based on the excitation of internal modes. Additionally, we observe that, on time scales comparable to the size of the circle, the collapse of large sphalerons mimics the kink-antikink scattering on the real line.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11634v1" target="_blank">Translating Between the Common Haar Random State Model and the Unitary   Model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eli Goldin, Mark Zhandry</p>
            <p>Black-box separations are a cornerstone of cryptography, indicating barriers to various goals. A recent line of work has explored black-box separations for quantum cryptographic primitives. Namely, a number of separations are known in the Common Haar Random State (CHRS) model, though this model is not considered a complete separation, but rather a starting point. A few very recent works have attempted to lift these separations to a unitary separation, which are considered complete separations. Unfortunately, we find significant errors in some of these lifting results.   We prove general conditions under which CHRS separations can be generically lifted, thereby giving simple, modular, and bug-free proofs of complete unitary separations between various quantum primitives. Our techniques allow for simpler proofs of existing separations as well as new separations that were previously only known in the CHRS model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11632v1" target="_blank">Self-Supervised Learning Strategies for Jet Physics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Rieck, Kyle Cranmer, Etienne Dreyer, Eilam Gross, Nilotpal Kakati, Dmitrii Kobylanskii, Garrett W. Merz, Nathalie Soybelman</p>
            <p>We extend the re-simulation-based self-supervised learning approach to learning representations of hadronic jets in colliders by exploiting the Markov property of the standard simulation chain. Instead of masking, cropping, or other forms of data augmentation, this approach simulates pairs of events where the initial portion of the simulation is shared, but the subsequent stages of the simulation evolve independently. When paired with a contrastive loss function, this naturally leads to representations that capture the physics in the initial stages of the simulation. In particular, we force the hard scattering and parton shower to be shared and let the hadronization and interaction with the detector evolve independently. We then evaluate the utility of these representations on downstream tasks.</p>
