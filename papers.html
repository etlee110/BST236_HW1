            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05474v1" target="_blank">3D Scene Generation: A Survey</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beichen Wen, Haozhe Xie, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Ziwei Liu</p>
            <p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05469v1" target="_blank">Generating Physically Stable and Buildable LEGO Designs from Text</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ava Pun, Kangle Deng, Ruixuan Liu, Deva Ramanan, Changliu Liu, Jun-Yan Zhu</p>
            <p>We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05468v1" target="_blank">A Solovay-Kitaev theorem for quantum signal processing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zane M. Rossi</p>
            <p>Quantum signal processing (QSP) studies quantum circuits interleaving known unitaries (the phases) and unknown unitaries encoding a hidden scalar (the signal). For a wide class of functions one can quickly compute the phases applying a desired function to the signal; surprisingly, this ability can be shown to unify many quantum algorithms. A separate, basic subfield in quantum computing is gate approximation: among its results, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem (SKT) establishes an equivalence between the universality of a gate set and its ability to efficiently approximate other gates.   In this work we prove an 'SKT for QSP,' showing that the density of parameterized circuit ans\"atze in classes of functions implies the existence of short circuits approximating desired functions. This is quite distinct from a pointwise application of the usual SKT, and yields a suite of independently interesting 'lifted' variants of standard SKT proof techniques. Our method furnishes alternative, flexible proofs for results in QSP, extends simply to ans\"atze for which standard QSP proof methods fail, and establishes a formal intersection between QSP and gate approximation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05466v1" target="_blank">Comparison of integral equations used to study $T_{cc}^+$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian M. Dawid, Fernando Romero-López, Stephen R. Sharpe</p>
            <p>We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19286v2" target="_blank">Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves   in light of Pulsar Timing Array</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Athron, Marco Chianese, Satyabrata Datta, Rome Samanta, Ninetta Saviano</p>
            <p>Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05463v1" target="_blank">Primordial black-hole formation and heavy r-process element synthesis   from the cosmological QCD transition. Two aspects of an inhomogeneous early   Universe</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gonin, G. Hasinger, D. Blaschke, O. Ivanytskyi, G. Röpke</p>
            <p>We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05462v1" target="_blank">Marsden--Meyer--Weinstein reduction for $k$-contact field theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. de Lucas, X. Rivas, S. Vilarino, B. M. Zawora</p>
            <p>This work devises a Marsden--Meyer--Weinstein $k$-contact reduction. Our techniques are illustrated with several examples of mathematical and physical relevance. As a byproduct, we review the previous contact reduction literature so as to clarify and to solve some inaccuracies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20422v3" target="_blank">Quantum-corrected anti-de Sitter space-time</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob C. Thompson, Elizabeth Winstanley</p>
            <p>We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05460v1" target="_blank">Reduced Basis Method for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hans Christiansen, Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske</p>
            <p>Reduced basis methods provide an efficient way of mapping out phase diagrams of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. The method relies on using the exact solutions at select parameter values to construct a low-dimensional basis, from which observables can be efficiently and reliably computed throughout the parameter space. Here we show that this method can be generalized to driven-dissipative Markovian systems allowing efficient calculations of observables in the transient and steady states. A subsequent distillation of the reduced basis vectors according to their explained variances allows for an unbiased exploration of the most pronounced parameter dependencies indicative of phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05458v1" target="_blank">Emergence of Spin-Polarized Unconventional Skin Effect in Hatano-Nelson   Model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moirangthem Sanahal, Subhasis Panda, Snehasish Nandy</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number in one dimension (1D). By investigating 1D spinful Hatano-Nelson model with Abelian gauge fields we uncover a tunable, unconventional spin-polarized NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a bidirectional conventional NHSE exhibiting nonzero winding. The unconventional skin modes display scale-restricted localization, distinguishing them from the critical NHSE. Upon introducing an external magnetic field coupled to the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes are suppressed, leading to spectral instability and the emergence of critical NHSE with system size-dependent non-Bloch spectra. Meanwhile, conventional skin modes persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions, relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.</p>
