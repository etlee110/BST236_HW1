            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23768v1" target="_blank">Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First   Star Formation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Yuan Ho, Ke-Jung Chen, Pei-Cheng Tung</p>
            <p>We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23764v1" target="_blank">MMSI-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Image Spatial Intelligence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sihan Yang, Runsen Xu, Yiman Xie, Sizhe Yang, Mo Li, Jingli Lin, Chenming Zhu, Xiaochen Chen, Haodong Duan, Xiangyu Yue, Dahua Lin, Tai Wang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
            <p>Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23755v1" target="_blank">Anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their gravity duals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilie Despontin, Stephane Detournay, Sudipta Dutta, Dima Fontaine</p>
            <p>We investigate anisotropic conformal Carroll field theories and their holographic duals. On the field theory side, we focus on the case with scaling exponent $z=0$ in two and three spacetime dimensions. These theories exhibit infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras, including supertranslations and superrotations, and are closely related to, but distinct from, Warped Conformal Field Theories. We construct the associated Carrollian stress tensor, derive its transformation properties, and analyse the structure of correlation functions under different choices of vacua. On the gravity side, we identify three and four-dimensional plane wave geometries whose isometry algebras realise the two- and three-dimensional Carroll algebra and anisotropic scale transformations. We propose, for each scaling exponent, a phase space of asymptotically-plane wave spacetimes and show that the residual diffeomorphisms reproduce the expected conformal Carroll field theory algebra, establishing a framework for anisotropic Carrollian holography.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15929v2" target="_blank">PhyX: Does Your Model Have the "Wits" for Physical Reasoning?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Shen, Taiqiang Wu, Qi Han, Yunta Hsieh, Jizhou Wang, Yuyue Zhang, Yuxin Cheng, Zijian Hao, Yuansheng Ni, Xin Wang, Zhongwei Wan, Kai Zhang, Wendong Xu, Jing Xiong, Ping Luo, Wenhu Chen, Chaofan Tao, Zhuoqing Mao, Ngai Wong</p>
            <p>Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence: physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge, symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics, electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5%, 42.2%, and 45.8% accuracy respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29% compared to human experts. Our analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility, we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23741v1" target="_blank">Fermion parity and quantum capacitance oscillation with partially   separated Majorana and quasi-Majorana modes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tudor D. Stanescu, Sumanta Tewari</p>
            <p>In a recent experiment, flux dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance were observed in a one dimensional spin-orbit coupled semiconductor superconductor heterostructure connected end to end via a quantum dot and threaded by a magnetic flux. In the topological superconducting phase of the heterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity sectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion parity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well separated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of the wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of quantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations alone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05440v2" target="_blank">Enabling GPU Portability into the Numba-JITed Monte Carlo Particle   Transport Code MC/DC</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joanna Piper Morgan, Braxton Cuneo, Ilham Variansyah, Kyle E. Niemeyer</p>
            <p>The Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport is developing Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC) as a portable Monte Carlo neutron transport package for rapid numerical methods exploration on CPU- and GPU-based high-performance computers. In this paper, we describe MC/DC's current event-based GPU algorithm as well as the just-in-time (JIT) compilation scheme we use to enable GPU operability on Nvidia and AMD GPUs from MC/DC's Python source. To analyze performance, we conduct runtime tests of the C5G7 k-eigenvalue benchmark problem and a continuous-energy infinite pin cell on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, AMD MI250X GPU, and the AMD MI300A APU and make comparison to a dual-socket Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapid CPU node. We found that for the multi-group C5G7 benchmark problem, we respectively see a 15$\times$, 0.7$\times$, 12$\times$ speedup on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A over 112 Intel Xeon CPU cores. For the continuous-energy infinite pin-cell benchmark, we found speedups of 5$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$ on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A, respectively, over the same CPU node.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08674v2" target="_blank">Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning   Force Fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17159v3" target="_blank">Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of   modulus</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teepanis Chachiyo</p>
            <p>The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse. An algorithm based on Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for computing exact integrals and their derivatives are also presented, which should be useful in a platform that special functions are not accessible such as web-based and firmware developments.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23717v1" target="_blank">Computerized Modeling of Electrophysiology and Pathoelectrophysiology of   the Atria -- How Much Detail is Needed?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olaf Dössel, Axel Loewe</p>
            <p>This review focuses on the computerized modeling of the electrophysiology of the human atria, emphasizing the simulation of common arrhythmias such as atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Which components of the model are necessary to accurately model arrhythmogenic tissue modifications, including remodeling, cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis, to ensure reliable simulations? The central question explored is the level of detail required for trustworthy simulations for a specific context of use. The review discusses the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting the risks of oversimplification and excessive detail. It covers various aspects of atrial modeling, from cellular to whole atria levels, including the influence of atrial geometry, fiber direction, anisotropy, and wall thickness on simulation outcomes. The article also examines the impact of different modeling approaches, such as volumetric 3D models, bilayer models, and single surface models, on the realism of simulations. In addition, it reviews the latest advances in the modeling of fibrotic tissue and the verification and validation of atrial models. The intended use of these models in planning and optimization of atrial ablation strategies is discussed, with a focus on personalized modeling for individual patients and cohort-based approaches for broader applications. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating experimental data and clinical validation to enhance the utility of computerized atrial models to improve patient outcomes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23712v1" target="_blank">Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark P. Hertzberg, Oleksandr S. Stashko</p>
            <p>We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</p>
