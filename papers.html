            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09612v1" target="_blank">Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi J. Zhao, Samuel J. Garratt, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09610v1" target="_blank">Morphological Classification of Galaxies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karen Masters</p>
            <p>The morphological classification of galaxies provides vital physical information about the orbital motions of stars in galaxies, and correlates in interesting ways with star formation history, and other physical properties. Galaxy morphological classification is a field with a history of more than 100 years of development, and many scientists have introduced new classification schemes, resulting in a sometimes confusing array of terminologies and overlapping classes. In this article I provide a brief historical review of galaxy classification, but focus mostly on providing a summary of how the morphological variety of galaxies seen in our expanding Universe are described. I review traditional visual classification, morphometric measurements, crowd-sourcing for large scale visual classifications (Galaxy Zoo), and of course the recent explosion of interest in making use of machine learning techniques for galaxy morphology classification. A look up table is provided for cross matching of various terminologies currently in use for galaxy morphology classification as well as brief definitions of the main morphological types.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15090v3" target="_blank">The prince and the pauper. A quantum paradox of Hilbert-space   fundamentalism</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica</p>
            <p>The quantum world is described by a unit vector in the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian. Do these abstract basis-independent objects give a complete description of the physical world, or should we include observables like positions and momenta and the decomposition into subsystems? According to "Hilbert-space fundamentalism" they give a complete description, and all other features of the physical world emerge from them (Carroll, arXiv:2103.09780). Here I will give a concrete refutation of this thesis based on the symmetries of the theory of quantum measurements. These results show that even if a tensor product structure is assumed along with the unit vector and the Hamiltonian, concrete physically distinct worlds can be described by the same structures.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09603v1" target="_blank">$B\to K\sf{+}invisible$, dark matter, and $CP$ violation in hyperon   decays</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Gang He, Xiao-Dong Ma, Jusak Tandean, German Valencia</p>
            <p>Recently the Belle II Collaboration has reported a measurement of the $B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ rate that is higher than the standard-model expectation. Since the emitted neutrinos are unobserved, the excess could be due to the $B^+$ decaying into a $K^+$ and a dark-matter pair. We entertain this possibility in a two-Higgs-doublet model supplemented with a real singlet scalar boson acting as the dark matter. This model also accommodates strangeness-changing interactions providing new sources of $CP$ violation which can affect hyperon and kaon nonleptonic transitions. We find that the resulting $CP$ violation in the hyperon sector can be significant, reaching the current empirical bounds, after taking into account constraints from kaon mixing and decay and from dark-matter relic-density data and direct searches including the Migdal effect. We demonstrate that the hyperon and kaon processes are complementary probes of this new-physics scenario. Its prediction for sizable hyperon $CP$ violation is potentially testable in ongoing experiments, such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb, and in next-generation ones like PANDA and at the Super Tau Charm Facility.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09602v1" target="_blank">Shadow Molecular Dynamics for a Charge-Potential Equilibration Model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert Stanton, Cagri Mehmet Kaymak, Anders M. N. Niklasson</p>
            <p>We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09599v1" target="_blank">A unique coupling of the massive spin-2 field to supergravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Bossard, Gabriele Casagrande, Emilian Dudas, Adrien Loty</p>
            <p>We show that the coupling of a massive spin-2 field to undeformed N=1 supergravity in four dimensions is unique, leading to a specific non-minimal coupling to the Riemann tensor. The massive spin-2 coupling reproduces the one of an oscillator mode in open string theory, while the massive spin-1 coupling includes a higher-derivative term that is expected to violate causality in the background of a gravitational shock wave. We argue that the resolution of causality and the unitarity bound in the Regge limit require the introduction of infinitely many higher-spin fields similar to the Regge trajectories in string theory, therefore providing an argument in favour of the string lamppost principle with minimal supersymmetry in four dimensions. To obtain this result, we construct the general stress-energy tensor multiplet for the massive spin-2 multiplet with N=1 supersymmetry.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09595v1" target="_blank">BenchQC: A Benchmarking Toolkit for Quantum Computation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nia Pollard, Kamal Choudhary</p>
            <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for quantum computing applications in chemistry and materials science, particularly in addressing the limitations of classical methods for complex systems. This study benchmarks the performance of the VQE for calculating ground-state energies of aluminum clusters (Al$^-$, Al$_2$, and Al$_3^-$) within a quantum-density functional theory (DFT) embedding framework, systematically varying key parameters -- (I) classical optimizers, (II) circuit types, (III) number of repetitions, (IV) simulator types, (V) basis sets, and (VI) noise models. Our findings demonstrate that certain optimizers achieve efficient and accurate convergence, while circuit choice and basis set selection significantly impact accuracy, with higher-level basis sets closely matching classical computation data from Numerical Python Solver (NumPy) and Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB). To evaluate the workflow under realistic conditions, we employed IBM noise models to simulate the effects of hardware noise. The results showed close agreement with CCCBDB benchmarks, with percent errors consistently below 0.02 percent. The results establish VQE's capability for reliable energy estimations and highlight the importance of optimizing quantum-DFT parameters to balance computational cost and precision. This work paves the way for broader VQE benchmarking on diverse chemical systems, with plans to make results accessible on Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) and develop a Python package to support the quantum chemistry and materials science communities in advancing quantum-enhanced discovery.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09593v1" target="_blank">Cosmological phase transitions from the functional measure</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Berganholi, Gláuber C. Dorsch, Iberê Kuntz, Beatriz M. D. Sena, Giovanna F. do Valle</p>
            <p>We investigate how competitive gravitational wave detectors can be to current and near-future colliders in probing a model where the new physics is completely encapsulated in a modified scalar sector. For this, we study a model where an additional logarithmic term arises in the scalar potential due to a non-trivial path integral measure, which is constructed using effective field theory. This new term alters the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and could lead to potentially detectable gravitational waves from the early Universe. Our results confirm the expectation that the intensity of such spectrum is highly correlated to the scalar field's self-coupling, and that gravitational wave experiments could therefore be used to probe these couplings with an accuracy competitive with the projected sensitivity of near-future colliders.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09592v1" target="_blank">A Data-Driven Method for Microgrid System Identification: Physically   Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohan Du, Xiaozhe Wang</p>
            <p>Microgrids (MGs) play a crucial role in utilizing distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind power, enhancing the sustainability and flexibility of modern power systems. However, the inherent variability in MG topology, power flow, and DER operating modes poses significant challenges to the accurate system identification of MGs, which is crucial for designing robust control strategies and ensuring MG stability. This paper proposes a Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (PC-SINDy) method for accurate MG system identification. By leveraging an analytically derived library of candidate functions, PC-SINDy extracts accurate dynamic models using only phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Simulations on a 4-bus system demonstrate that PC-SINDy can reliably and accurately predict frequency trajectories under large disturbances, including scenarios not encountered during the identification/training phase, even when using noisy, low-sampled PMU data.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09588v1" target="_blank">The Eigenfunctions of the Transfer Operator for the Dyson model in a   field</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirmukhsin Makhmudov</p>
            <p>The recent works \cite{EFMV2024} and \cite{JOP2023} have studied the spectral properties of the Dyson model in the absence of an external field. This paper is a continuation of \cite{EFMV2024} and aims to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating the Dyson model in a field.\\ In this paper, we prove that, for high temperatures or strong magnetic fields, there exists a non-negative, integrable (with respect to the unique half-line Gibbs measure) eigenfunction of the transfer operator for the Dyson model if $\alpha\in(\frac 3 2,2]$. However, unlike in the zero-magnetic-field case, this eigenfunction is not continuous.</p>
