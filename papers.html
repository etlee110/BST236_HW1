            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15802v1" target="_blank">A Deep Learning Framework for Two-Dimensional, Multi-Frequency   Propagation Factor Estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah E. Wessinger, Leslie N. Smith, Jacob Gull, Jonathan Gehman, Zachary Beever, Andrew J. Kammerer</p>
            <p>Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14652v3" target="_blank">General-Reasoner: Advancing LLM Reasoning Across All Domains</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueguang Ma, Qian Liu, Dongfu Jiang, Ge Zhang, Zejun Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15789v1" target="_blank">CMB Lensing Trispectrum as a Probe of Parity Violation in LSS</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Greco, Zachary Slepian, Jiamin Hou, Alex Krolewski</p>
            <p>We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is sensitive to parity violation in Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We obtain a compact expression for the reduced lensing trispectrum that is general for any input matter trispectrum. We then present as an example a simple parity-violating toy model for the latter, and explicitly compute the parity-odd lensing trispectrum, including an estimate of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This work serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating how future studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing is sensitive to parity. Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used to probe parity in LSS, and will be important in enabling upcoming experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 to contribute maximal power on parity violation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16123v2" target="_blank">The DKP Equation in Presence of a Woods-Saxon Potential: Transmission   Resonances and Bound States</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Garzón, Ricardo Fernández, Vicente A. Arévalo, David Laroze, Laura M. Pérez, Benjamín de Zayas, Clara Rojas</p>
            <p>In this article, we solve the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in the presence of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier and well for spin-one particles. We derive the scattering solution in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, the regularized Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2\tilde{F}_1(a, b; c; z)$, and the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$. Our analysis reveals the presence of transmission resonances. To observe these resonances, we calculate and plot the transmission $T$ and reflection $R$ coefficients for various parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Our results are compared with those obtained for the square potential barrier and the cusp potential barrier, which represent limiting cases of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Furthermore, we investigate the bound state solutions, determining the critical turning point $V_{cr}$ to study particle-antiparticle creation and compute the norm $N$. Finally, we also compare our results with those obtained for the square potential well and the cusp potential well, confirming that pair creation occurs in both potential wells.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15787v1" target="_blank">Flavour hierarchies, extended groups and composites</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier M. Lizana</p>
            <p>In these proceedings, I present a composite Higgs model in which the flavour hierarchies between the third and light families emerge naturally. In particular, CKM mixing angles turn out to be suppressed while PMNS matrix remains anarchic. This flavour structure arises as a consequence of the extended non-universal gauge symmetry of the model and the electroweak charges of the fundamental fermions of the new composite sector that realises the Higgs boson as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. The model is described in detail in arXiv:2412.14243.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10918v2" target="_blank">Resource Heterogeneity-Aware and Utilization-Enhanced Scheduling for   Deep Learning Clusters</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abeda Sultana, Nabin Pakka, Fei Xu, Xu Yuan, Li Chen, Nian-Feng Tzeng</p>
            <p>Scheduling deep learning (DL) models to train on powerful clusters with accelerators like GPUs and TPUs, presently falls short, either lacking fine-grained heterogeneity awareness or leaving resources substantially under-utilized. To fill this gap, we propose a novel design of a task-level heterogeneity-aware scheduler, Hadar, based on an optimization framework that can boost resource utilization. Hadar leverages the performance traits of DL jobs on a heterogeneous DL cluster, characterizes the task-level performance heterogeneity in the optimization problem, and makes scheduling decisions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. It involves the primal-dual framework employing a dual subroutine, to solve the optimization problem and guide the scheduling design. Our trace-driven simulation with representative DL model training workloads demonstrates that Hadar accelerates the total time duration by 1.20x when compared with its state-of-the-art heterogeneity-aware counterpart, Gavel. Further, our Hadar scheduler is enhanced to HadarE by forking each job into multiple copies to let a job train concurrently on heterogeneous GPUs resided on separate available nodes (i.e., machines or servers) for resource utilization enhancement. HadarE is evaluated extensively on physical DL clusters for comparison with Hadar and Gavel. With substantial enhancement in cluster resource utilization (by 1.45x), HadarE exhibits considerable speed-ups in DL model training, reducing the total time duration by 50% (or 80%) on an Amazon's AWS (or our lab) cluster, while producing trained DL models with consistently better inference quality than those trained by Hadar.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15785v1" target="_blank">Rescuing 331 bileptons from the Landau pole</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Morisi, Giovanna Paola Perdonà, Giulia Ricciardi</p>
            <p>Among the particles being searched for at the LHC beyond the Standard Model are bileptons, which are doubly charged gauge bosons. Bileptons are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models with $\beta = \sqrt 3$. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole, which can undermine current predictions for TeV-scale bileptons. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11578v2" target="_blank">Spatiotemporal Field Generation Based on Hybrid Mamba-Transformer with   Physics-informed Fine-tuning</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peimian Du, Jiabin Liu, Xiaowei Jin, Mengwang Zuo, Hui Li</p>
            <p>This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21602v2" target="_blank">A Generative Diffusion Model to Solve Inverse Problems for Robust   in-NICU Neonatal MRI</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yamin Arefeen, Brett Levac, Jonathan I. Tamir</p>
            <p>We present the first acquisition-agnostic diffusion generative model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to solve a range of inverse problems for shortening scan time and improving motion robustness. In-NICU MRI scanners leverage permanent magnets at lower field-strengths (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) for non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early live development, but suffer from long scan times and motion artifacts. In this setting, training data sizes are small and intrinsically suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work trains a diffusion probabilistic generative model using such a real-world training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI by applying several novel signal processing and machine learning methods to handle the low SNR and low quantity of data. The model is then used as a statistical image prior to solve various inverse problems at inference time without requiring any retraining. Experiments demonstrate the generative model's utility for three real-world applications of neonatal MRI: accelerated reconstruction, motion correction, and super-resolution.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15783v1" target="_blank">Rapid phase ordering for Ising and Potts dynamics on random regular   graphs</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Gheissari, Allan Sly, Youngtak Sohn</p>
            <p>We consider the Ising, and more generally, $q$-state Potts Glauber dynamics on random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices at low temperatures $\beta \gtrsim \frac{\log d}{d}$. The mixing time is exponential in $n$ due to a bottleneck between $q$ dominant phases consisting of configurations in which the majority of vertices are in the same state. We prove that for any $d\ge 7$, from biased initializations with $\epsilon_d n$ more vertices in state-$1$ than in other states, the Glauber dynamics quasi-equilibrates to the stationary distribution conditioned on having plurality in state-$1$ in optimal $O(\log n)$ time. Moreover, the requisite initial bias $\epsilon_d$ can be taken to zero as $d \to \infty$. Even for the $q=2$ Ising case, where the states are naturally identified with $\pm 1$, proving such a result requires a new approach in order to control negative information spread in spacetime despite the model being in low temperature and exhibiting strong local correlations. For this purpose, we introduce a coupled non-Markovian rigid dynamics for which a delicate temporal recursion on probability mass functions of minus spacetime cluster sizes establishes their subcriticality.</p>
