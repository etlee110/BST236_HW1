            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15283v1" target="_blank">Simultaneously Modelling Dusty Star Forming Galaxies and Massive   Quiescents: A Calibration Framework for Galaxy Formation Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Araya-Araya, Rachel K. Cochrane, Christopher C. Hayward, Laerte Sodr√© Jr., Robert M. Yates, Marcel P. van Daalen, Marcelo C. Vicentin</p>
            <p>Galaxy formation models, particularly semi-analytic models (SAMs), rely on differential equations with free parameters to describe the physical mechanisms governing galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, most SAMs calibrate these parameters manually to match observational data. However, this approach fails to fully explore the multidimensional parameter space, resulting in limited robustness and inconsistency with some observations. In contrast, the L-Galaxies SAM features a unique Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mode, enabling robust model calibration. Using this functionality, we address a long-standing tension in galaxy formation models: simultaneously reproducing the number densities of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and high-redshift massive quiescent galaxies (MQs). We test nine combinations of observational constraints - including stellar mass functions, quiescent fractions, neutral hydrogen mass functions, and DSFG number densities - across different redshifts. We then analyze the resulting galaxy property predictions and discuss the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results identify a model that reasonably matches the number density of DSFGs while remaining consistent with observationally-derived lower limits on the number density of high-redshift MQs. This model requires high star formation efficiencies in mergers and a null dependency of supermassive black hole (SMBH) cold gas accretion on halo mass, facilitating rapid stellar mass and SMBH growth. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of robust calibration procedures to address the significant degeneracies inherent to multidimensional galaxy formation models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15282v1" target="_blank">Multi-Target Rydberg Gates via Spatial Blockade Engineering</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Stein, Chenxu Liu, Shuwen Kan, Eleanor Crane, Yufei Ding, Ying Mao, Alexander Shuckert, Ang Li</p>
            <p>Multi-target gates offer the potential to reduce gate depth in syndrome extraction for quantum error correction. Although neutral-atom quantum computers have demonstrated native multi-qubit gates, existing approaches that avoid additional control or multiple atomic species have been limited to single-target gates. We propose single-control-multi-target CZ^{\otimes N}) gates on a single-species neutral-atom platform that require no extra control and have gate durations comparable to standard CZ gates. Our approach leverages tailored interatomic distances to create an asymmetric blockade between the control and target atoms. Using a GPU-accelerated pulse synthesis protocol, we design smooth control pulses for CZZ and CZZZ gates, achieving fidelities of up to 99.55% and 99.24%, respectively, even in the presence of simulated atom placement errors and Rydberg-state decay. This work presents a practical path to implementing multi-target gates in neutral-atom systems, significantly reducing the resource overhead for syndrome extraction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15277v1" target="_blank">A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting   Dying Planets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kylee Carden, B. Scott Gaudi, Robert F. Wilson</p>
            <p>The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~10^5 transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15276v1" target="_blank">Improved Algorithms for Quantum MaxCut via Partially Entangled Matchings</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anuj Apte, Eunou Lee, Kunal Marwaha, Ojas Parekh, James Sud</p>
            <p>We introduce a $0.611$-approximation algorithm for Quantum MaxCut and a $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809$-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian of [arXiv:2209.02589]. A novel ingredient in both of these algorithms is to partially entangle pairs of qubits associated to edges in a matching, while preserving the direction of their single-qubit Bloch vectors. This allows us to interpolate between product states and matching-based states with a tunable parameter.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15274v1" target="_blank">Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Hamidreza Mirpoorian, Karsten Jedamzik, Levon Pogosian</p>
            <p>Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data clearly favors modified recombination over DDE, suggesting that current claims of a DDE detection may be premature.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15272v1" target="_blank">Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the   highest-energy astroparticle events</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohta Murase, Yuma Narita, Wen Yin</p>
            <p>Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a "natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero scalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed coordinates may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15265v1" target="_blank">Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the   Cross-Resonance scheme</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yash Saxena, Sagnik Chatterjee, Tharrmashastha Sapv</p>
            <p>Three-level systems have natural advantages over their two-level counterparts in quantum information and computation. Although generally used for qubits, the existing superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to three levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space. Realizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal quantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the state-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a high-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance framework. Using our framework, we experimentally demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ gates through simulations on QISKIT dynamics, which in turn allow us to obtain a maximum extracted concurrence of $97.2\pm0.1\%$, thereby demonstrating that entanglement has been achieved on all three levels. Using the above gates, we also prepare a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $96.9\pm 0.1\%$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15264v1" target="_blank">Sunflowers and Ramsey problems for restricted intersections</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barnab√°s Janzer, Zhihan Jin, Benny Sudakov, Kewen Wu</p>
            <p>Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.   As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\"uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15262v1" target="_blank">Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally Constrained Neural   Fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Zhao, Aviad Levis, Liam Connor, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
            <p>Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused primarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15259v1" target="_blank">Bringing Diversity from Diffusion Models to Semantic-Guided Face Asset   Generation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunxuan Cai, Sitao Xiang, Zongjian Li, Haiwei Chen, Yajie Zhao</p>
            <p>Digital modeling and reconstruction of human faces serve various applications. However, its availability is often hindered by the requirements of data capturing devices, manual labor, and suitable actors. This situation restricts the diversity, expressiveness, and control over the resulting models. This work aims to demonstrate that a semantically controllable generative network can provide enhanced control over the digital face modeling process. To enhance diversity beyond the limited human faces scanned in a controlled setting, we introduce a novel data generation pipeline that creates a high-quality 3D face database using a pre-trained diffusion model. Our proposed normalization module converts synthesized data from the diffusion model into high-quality scanned data. Using the 44,000 face models we obtained, we further developed an efficient GAN-based generator. This generator accepts semantic attributes as input, and generates geometry and albedo. It also allows continuous post-editing of attributes in the latent space. Our asset refinement component subsequently creates physically-based facial assets. We introduce a comprehensive system designed for creating and editing high-quality face assets. Our proposed model has undergone extensive experiment, comparison and evaluation. We also integrate everything into a web-based interactive tool. We aim to make this tool publicly available with the release of the paper.</p>
