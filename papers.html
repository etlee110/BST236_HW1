            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10566v1" target="_blank">3D-Fixup: Advancing Photo Editing with 3D Priors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yen-Chi Cheng, Krishna Kumar Singh, Jae Shin Yoon, Alex Schwing, Liangyan Gui, Matheus Gadelha, Paul Guerrero, Nanxuan Zhao</p>
            <p>Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15285v2" target="_blank">AneuPy: An open source Python tool for creating simulation-ready   geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario de Lucio, Jacobo Diaz, Alberto de Castro, Luis E. Romera</p>
            <p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical. The geometrical characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, are extremely significant in biomechanical models for the assessment of rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10556v1" target="_blank">An AI-driven framework for the prediction of personalised health   response to air pollution</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nazanin Zounemat Kermani, Sadjad Naderi, Claire H. Dilliway, Claire E. Heaney, Shrreya Behll, Boyang Chen, Hisham Abubakar-Waziri, Alexandra E. Porter, Marc Chadeau-Hyam, Fangxin Fang, Ian M. Adcock, Kian Fan Chung, Christopher C. Pain</p>
            <p>Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, causing or exacerbating many respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, climate change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework. We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world, user-generated data.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10553v1" target="_blank">Flowing Through Hilbert Space: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for   Lattice Field Theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehu Martinez, Andrea Delgado</p>
            <p>Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03795v2" target="_blank">Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group   Dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Skaggs, Jacob W. Crandall</p>
            <p>Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network game.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13360v4" target="_blank">Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10550v1" target="_blank">Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milena Horvath, Alvise Bastianello, Sudipta Dhar, Rebekka Koch, Yanliang Guo, Jean-Sébastien Caux, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl</p>
            <p>Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10544v1" target="_blank">High-endurance mechanical switching in a DNA origami snap-through   mechanism</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Rothfischer, Lennart J. K. Weiß, Niccolò Tedeschi, Michael Matthies, Matthias Vogt, Christoph Karfusehr, Alexander Hebel, Petr Šulc, Tim Liedl, Enzo Kopperger, Friedrich C. Simmel</p>
            <p>Switchable elements are key components of dynamic technological and biological systems, enabling reversible transitions between well-defined states. Here, we present a DNA origami-based, mechanically bistable snap-through mechanism that can be electrically controlled. This nanoscale switch exhibits long-term stability in both states in the absence of external stimuli, while achieving millisecond-scale switching times upon application of an electric field. Individual devices sustain hundreds of thousands of switching cycles over several hours, offering a powerful platform for systematically studying the endurance and failure mechanisms of biomolecular nanoswitches. Functionalization with a gold nanorod further allows polarization-dependent optical modulation, opening avenues for applications in plasmonics. This versatile electromechanical interface has potential uses in molecular information processing, optical nanodevices, and the dynamic control of chemical reactions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08787v3" target="_blank">UniSkill: Imitating Human Videos via Cross-Embodiment Skill   Representations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanjung Kim, Jaehyun Kang, Hyolim Kang, Meedeum Cho, Seon Joo Kim, Youngwoon Lee</p>
            <p>Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05084v2" target="_blank">Thermal boundary conductance in standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN   heterostructures predicted using machine learning interatomic potentials</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhou, Khalid Zobaid Adnan, Wyatt Allen Jones, Tianli Feng</p>
            <p>GaN/AlN interfaces are essential in advanced high-power and high-frequency electronic devices, where effective thermal management is crucial for optimal performance and reliability. This work investigates the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine learning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory calculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2 K-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic and ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions (400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second GaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the original interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually decreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple interfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be further enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces, superlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of TBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by the ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material. Additionally, a "critical separation distance" (l_cs) is defined as the threshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and behave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons filtered by the interfaces that transport in the middle layer between two interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the thermal transport mechanisms that may aid the design of future electronic devices.</p>
