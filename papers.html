            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19908v1" target="_blank">Characterising M dwarf host stars of two candidate Hycean worlds</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lalitha Sairam, Nikku Madhusudhan</p>
            <p>Planetary systems orbiting M dwarf host stars are promising targets for atmospheric characterisation of low-mass exoplanets. Accurate characterisation of M dwarf hosts is important for detailed understanding of the planetary properties and physical processes, including potential habitability. Recent studies have identified several candidate Hycean planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs as promising targets in the search for habitability and life on exoplanets. In this study, we characterise two such M dwarf host stars, K2-18 and TOI-732. Using archival photometric and spectroscopic observations, we estimate their effective temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$) and metallicities through high-resolution spectral analyses and ages through gyrochronology. We assess the stellar activity of the targets by analysing activity-sensitive chromospheric lines and X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we predict activity cycles based on measured rotation periods and utilise photometric data to estimate the current stellar activity phase. We find K2-18 to be 2.9-3.1 Gyr old with T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 3645$\pm$52 K and metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10$\pm$0.12 dex, and TOI-732 to be older (6.7-8.6 Gyr), cooler (3213$\pm$92 K), and more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22$\pm$0.13 dex). Both stars exhibit relatively low activity making them favourable for atmospheric observations of their planets. The predicted activity cycle and analysis of available high-precision photometry for K2-18 suggest that it might have been near an activity minimum during recent JWST observations, though some residual activity may be expected at such minima. We predict potential activity levels for both targets to aid future observations, and highlight the importance of accurate characterisation of M dwarf host stars for exoplanet characterisation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19905v1" target="_blank">Helmet streamer influence on the evolution of magnetic flux ropes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cécere, P. F. Wyper, G. Krause, A. Sahade, O. E. K. Rice</p>
            <p>Context: Solar eruptions are crucial for space weather studies. Understanding the mechanisms influencing their evolution is key to improving predictions of their geoeffectiveness. Helmet streamers (HSs) are persistent structures in the solar corona, present in both minimum and maximum solar activity periods. These structures contain a current sheet of low magnetic energy, where coronal mass ejections (CMEs) tend to deflect. However, they also feature a closed magnetic field region beneath this sheet, often confining eruptions. Their complexity makes predicting eruptions challenging. Aims: This study examines how HSs influence the evolution and potential confinement of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). We explore magnetic configurations where the MFR is more likely to rise through the overlying field, aiming to establish simple parameters that help predict whether an MFR will ascend or remain confined. Methods: Using 2.5D MHD simulations, we model MFR dynamics in the presence of an HS, analyzing different magnetic configurations and focusing on the mechanisms that enable ascent or confinement. Results: Null-point reconnection plays a key role in MFR dynamics. Depending on the initial configuration, it can either disrupt the MFR, preventing ascent, or reduce the strapping flux, facilitating upward motion. We identify a critical threshold: if the strapping flux above the MFR is less than two-thirds of its poloidal flux, the MFR ascends successfully. Conclusions: Our simulations show that null-point reconnection significantly impacts MFR ascent. A key predictor of successful rise is the initial ratio of the MFR's poloidal flux to the strapping flux above it.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19901v1" target="_blank">TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through   Task Tokenization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Pan, Zeshi Yang, Zhiyang Dou, Wenjia Wang, Buzhen Huang, Bo Dai, Taku Komura, Jingbo Wang</p>
            <p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks. Website: https://liangpan99.github.io/TokenHSI/</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19896v1" target="_blank">Energetic advantages for quantum agents in online execution of complex   strategies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayne Thompson, Paul M. Riechers, Andrew J. P. Garner, Thomas J. Elliott, Mile Gu</p>
            <p>Agents often execute complex strategies -- adapting their response to each input stimulus depending on past observations and actions. Here, we derive the minimal energetic cost for classical agents to execute a given strategy, highlighting that they must dissipate a certain amount of heat with each decision beyond Landauer's limit. We then prove that quantum agents can reduce this dissipation below classical limits. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a strategy to guarantee quantum agents have energetic advantage, and illustrate settings where this advantage grows without bound. Our results establish a fundamental energetic advantage for agents utilizing quantum processing to enact complex adaptive behaviour.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19894v1" target="_blank">Versatile Cross-platform Compilation Toolchain for Schrödinger-style   Quantum Circuit Simulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuncheng Lu, Shuang Liang, Hongxiang Fan, Ce Guo, Wayne Luk, Paul H. J. Kelly</p>
            <p>While existing quantum hardware resources have limited availability and reliability, there is a growing demand for exploring and verifying quantum algorithms. Efficient classical simulators for high-performance quantum simulation are critical to meeting this demand. However, due to the vastly varied characteristics of classical hardware, implementing hardware-specific optimizations for different hardware platforms is challenging.   To address such needs, we propose CAST (Cross-platform Adaptive Schr\"odiner-style Simulation Toolchain), a novel compilation toolchain with cross-platform (CPU and Nvidia GPU) optimization and high-performance backend supports. CAST exploits a novel sparsity-aware gate fusion algorithm that automatically selects the best fusion strategy and backend configuration for targeted hardware platforms. CAST also aims to offer versatile and high-performance backend for different hardware platforms. To this end, CAST provides an LLVM IR-based vectorization optimization for various CPU architectures and instruction sets, as well as a PTX-based code generator for Nvidia GPU support.   We benchmark CAST against IBM Qiskit, Google QSimCirq, Nvidia cuQuantum backend, and other high-performance simulators. On various 32-qubit CPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 8.03x speedup than Qiskit. On various 30-qubit GPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 39.3x speedup than Nvidia cuQuantum backend.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16837v2" target="_blank">Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated   entanglement between atom qubits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Apolín, David P. Nadlinger</p>
            <p>Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19891v1" target="_blank">Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric   amplifiers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tasnum Reza, Sergey M. Frolov</p>
            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19883v1" target="_blank">Quadrupolar and Dipolar Excitons in Bilayer 2$H$-MoSe$_2$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Feng, Aidan J. Campbell, Bibi Mary Francis, Hyeonjun Baek, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Iann C. Gerber, Brian D. Gerardot, Mauro Brotons-Gisbert</p>
            <p>We report the experimental observation of quadrupolar exciton states in the reflectance contrast spectrum of 2$H$-stacked bilayer MoSe$_2$. The application of a vertical electric field results in a quadratic energy redshift of these quadrupolar excitons, in contrast to the linear energy splitting observed in the coexisting dipolar excitons within the bilayer MoSe$_2$. We perform helicity-resolved reflectance contrast measurements to investigate the spin and valley configurations of the quadrupolar exciton states as a function of applied vertical electric and magnetic fields. Comparing our results with a phenomenological coupled-oscillator model indicates that the electric- and magnetic-field dependence of the quadrupolar exciton states can be attributed to the intravalley and intervalley hybridization of spin-triplet interlayer excitons with opposite permanent dipole moments, mediated by interlayer hole tunneling. These results position naturally stacked MoSe$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform to explore electric-field-tunable many-body exciton phenomena.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19882v1" target="_blank">Inverse Hamiltonian reduction in type A and generalized slices in the   affine Grassmannian</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dylan Butson, Sujay Nair</p>
            <p>We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all finite W-algebras in type $A$, a certain embedding of the finite W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of differential operators. We first prove a classical analogue for equivariant Slodowy slices using multiplication maps on generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian, then deduce the result for equivariant finite W-algebras by Fedosov quantization. This implies the statement for finite W-algebras, as well as Kostant-Whittaker reductions of arbitrary algebras in the category of Harish Chandra bimodules, including quantizations of Moore--Tachikawa varieties.</p>

            <p>HALHF is a hybrid linear collider that uses electron-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration to accelerate electrons to high energy while using radio-frequency cavity technology to accelerate positrons. The most cost-effective solution collides low-energy positrons with high-energy electrons, producing a boost to the final state in the electron direction with $\gamma= 1.67$. The current HALHF baseline design produces a luminosity comparable to that of the baseline ILC but with a greatly reduced construction and carbon footprint and hence much lower cost than the mature linear-collider designs ILC and CLIC. Costs for HALHF are evaluated, together with that for the approximate 15-year R\&D programme necessary to realise HALHF. Time scales and cost for the R\&D are estimated. Upgrade paths for HALHF technology from a 250~GeV Higgs factory, through 380 and 550~GeV, up to 10~TeV are sketched.</p>
