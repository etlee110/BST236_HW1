            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17438v1" target="_blank">The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid   Period-Luminosity Relation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louise Breuval, Caroline D. Huang, Adam G. Riess</p>
            <p>Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21776v4" target="_blank">Properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Seetharaman, Chetanya Singh, Rejish Nath</p>
            <p>We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17430v1" target="_blank">Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott semimetal   and symmetric pseudogap metal</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we demonstrate that Mott physics in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be conveniently captured using the ancilla theory, originally proposed in the context of high-Tc cuprates [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17426v1" target="_blank">Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in   LISA</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ollie Burke, Sylvain Marsat, Jonathan R. Gair, Michael L. Katz</p>
            <p>Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17389v2" target="_blank">Safe Leaf Manipulation for Accurate Shape and Pose Estimation of   Occluded Fruits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoxiong Yao, Sicong Pan, Maren Bennewitz, Kris Hauser</p>
            <p>Fruit monitoring plays an important role in crop management, and rising global fruit consumption combined with labor shortages necessitates automated monitoring with robots. However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14734v2" target="_blank">An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational   pair production</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heino Falcke, Michael F. Wondrak, Walter D. van Suijlekom</p>
            <p>Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time, although primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$ should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10549v2" target="_blank">Bottomoniumlike states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and   resummation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Giovanni Celiberto, Gabriele Gatto</p>
            <p>We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomoniumlike" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15090v2" target="_blank">Expected Tracking Performance of the ATLAS Inner Tracker at the   High-Luminosity LHC</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong>  ATLAS Collaboration</p>
            <p>The high-luminosity phase of LHC operations (HL-LHC), will feature a large increase in simultaneous proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing up to 200, compared with a typical leveling target of 64 in Run 3. Such an increase will create a very challenging environment in which to perform charged particle trajectory reconstruction, a task crucial for the success of the ATLAS physics program, and will exceed the capabilities of the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). A new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) will replace the current ID in time for the start of the HL-LHC. To ensure successful use of the ITk capabilities in Run 4 and beyond, the ATLAS tracking software has been successfully adapted to achieve state-of-the-art track reconstruction in challenging high-luminosity conditions with the ITk detector. This paper presents the expected tracking performance of the ATLAS ITk based on the latest available developments since the ITk technical design reports.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17413v1" target="_blank">Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. S. Le, S. W. Hancock, N. Tripathi, H. M. Milchberg</p>
            <p>We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17412v1" target="_blank">Invariance principle for the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos via a high   dimensional CLT with low rank increments</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly</p>
            <p>Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is a canonical random fractal measure obtained by exponentiating log-correlated Gaussian processes, first constructed in the seminal work of Kahane (1985). Since then it has served as an important building block in constructions of quantum field theories and Liouville quantum gravity. However, in many natural settings, non-Gaussian log-correlated processes arise. In this paper, we investigate the universality of GMC through an invariance principle. We consider the model of a random Fourier series, a process known to be log-correlated. While the Gaussian Fourier series has been a classical object of study, recently, the non-Gaussian counterpart was investigated and the associated multiplicative chaos constructed by Junnila in 2016. We show that the Gaussian and non-Gaussian variables can be coupled so that the associated chaos measures are almost surely mutually absolutely continuous throughout the entire sub-critical regime. This solves the main open problem from Kim and Kriechbaum (2024) who had earlier established such a result for a part of the regime. The main ingredient is a new high dimensional CLT for a sum of independent (but not i.i.d.) random vectors belonging to rank one subspaces with error bounds involving the isotropic properties of the covariance matrix of the sum, which we expect will find other applications. The proof relies on a path-wise analysis of Skorokhod embeddings as well as a perturbative result about square roots of positive semi-definite matrices which, surprisingly, appears to be new.</p>
