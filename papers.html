            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07815v1" target="_blank">Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-Guided Agentic Exploration with   Vision-Language Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungjae Lee, Daniel Ekpo, Haowen Liu, Furong Huang, Abhinav Shrivastava, Jia-Bin Huang</p>
            <p>Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07811v1" target="_blank">Exploring Potential Higgs Resonances at 650 GeV and 95 GeV in the 2HDM   Type III</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rachid Benbrik, Mohammed Boukidi, Khouloud Kahime, Stefano Moretti, Larbi Rahili, Bassim Taki</p>
            <p>Recent searches by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the `diphoton plus $b\bar{b}$ final state' have revealed an excess near 650 GeV, which might indicate the presence of a (broad) heavy resonance decaying into a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and an additional particle. At the same time, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large Electron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light Higgs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between these two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the context of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our proposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV decays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson subsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\bar{b}$ pairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This configuration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and low-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the 2.5$\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed anomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05575v2" target="_blank">Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator   Entanglement Spectrum</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben T. McDonough, Claudio Chamon, Justin H. Wilson, Thomas Iadecola</p>
            <p>Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14199v2" target="_blank">The stable "Unstable Natural Media" due to the presence of turbulence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ka Wai Ho, Ka Ho Yuen, Alex Lazarian</p>
            <p>The term "unstable neutral media" (UNM) has traditionally been used to describe the transient phase formed between the warm and cold neutral hydrogen (HI) phases and has not been the focus of HI studies. However, recent observations suggest that the UNM phase not only has a significantly longer-than-expected lifetime but also occupies at least 20\% to 40\% of both the volume and mass fraction of HI. In this paper, we argue that the existence and dominance of the UNM can be explained by the presence of strong turbulence using an energy balance argument. The mass fraction of UNM is directly proportional to the turbulent velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$: mass fraction of UNM $\propto \sigma_v^{\frac{2n}{1+n}}$, where $n$ is the absolute value of the adiabatic index in the unstable phase. We discuss the implications of long-lived unstable thermal phases on ISM physics, including cold dense filament formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and measurement of galactic foreground statistics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07804v1" target="_blank">Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Clifford, Matchgates and   Entanglement</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixuan Feng, Zhengwei Liu, Fan Lu, Ningfeng Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a unified classical simulation framework for quantum circuits, termed Quon Classical Simulation (QCS), built upon the diagrammatic formalism of the Quon language. Central to this framework is the introduction of magic holes, a topological feature that captures the global source of computational hardness in simulating quantum systems. Unlike conventional measures, the complexity of QCS is governed by the topological entanglement entropy associated with these magic holes. We show that Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of magic holes and thus efficiently simulable within our model. To capture the interaction structure of magic holes, we define a topological tensor network representation and develop novel skein relations and reduction algorithms to simplify circuit representations. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of classical simulations and provides a unified explanation for the tractability of various known quantum circuit classes. Our work offers a new topological perspective on the classical simulability of quantum systems and topological complexity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13467v2" target="_blank">The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Illien</p>
            <p>The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07801v1" target="_blank">Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU): conventional,   hybrid, and neural network material model discovery including   history-dependency</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernardo P. Ferreira, Miguel A. Bessa</p>
            <p>We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU) framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully designed and documented software named HookeAI.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07798v1" target="_blank">PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather   than Hermiticity in scattering processes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip D. Mannheim</p>
            <p>While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude being able to take support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether states are square integrable or not. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two. Our analysis shows that the nonrelativistic square well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07795v1" target="_blank">Mixed state deep thermalization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07794v1" target="_blank">Disparity in sound speeds: implications for unitarity and effective   potential in quantum field theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva</p>
            <p>We develop a complete unitarity framework for quantum field theories whose massive scalar excitations propagate at different sound speeds. Starting from first principles we derive the exact partial-wave unitarity condition for $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering with arbitrary masses and velocity hierarchies, recovering the standard and massless limits as special cases. Applying the formalism to a renormalizable two-field model we verify the optical theorem at one loop and obtain compact, velocity-dependent perturbative unitarity bounds. Then we compute the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential in the background-field method, tracking how a small splitting between sound speeds reshapes the renormalization-group flow. We find that all of quartic $\beta$-functions are rescaled in such a way that an accidental fixed line emerges.</p>
