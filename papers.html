            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18537v1" target="_blank">Renormalizing Two-Fermion Operators in the SMEFT via Supergeometry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benoît Assi, Andreas Helset, Julie Pagès, Chia-Hsien Shen</p>
            <p>We extend the geometric framework of field-space covariance for loop computations, thereby unifying the treatment of scalars, fermions, and gauge bosons in effective field theories. This allows us to derive a manifestly covariant formula for one-loop UV divergences that includes contributions from mixed boson-fermion graphs. The result is expressed in terms of geometric invariants of the field-space supermanifold. As a demonstration of this formula, we compute the renormalization group equations for two-fermion operators at the dimension-eight level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18531v1" target="_blank">Comment on "Superconductivity and Mott Physics in Organic Charge   Transfer Materials"</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rupali Jindal, Sumit Mazumdar, R. Torsten Clay</p>
            <p>Menke et al. recently claimed that superconductivity (SC) in the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer solids (CTS) can be understood within the two-dimensional half-filled anisotropic triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Experimentally, $\kappa$-CTS are mostly but not always antiferromagnetic (AFM) at ambient pressure and SC appears under pressure. In apparent agreement with this observation, Menke et al. found AFM ground states for small $t/U$ and SC over a small region at the interface of AFM and Fermi liquid ground states with increasing $t/U$ at fixed $t'/t$, where $U$ is the Hubbard repulsion. Menke et al's computational results directly contradict those obtained using exact diagonalization and Path Integral Renormalization Group approaches. It is clearly of interest to determine the origin of this discrepancy, especially in view of the facts that (a) related arguments continue to persist in the context of cuprate SC superconductivity (which however involves doping), and (b) there exist CTS in which SC is not proximate to AFM, but is separated by an intermediate charge-disproportionated phase. Here we show that Menke et al's conclusion regarding SC is incorrect and originates from a flawed assumption.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18527v1" target="_blank">Classical Interfaces for Controlling Cryogenic Quantum Computing   Technologies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack C. Brennan, Joao Barbosa, Chong Li, Meraj Ahmad, Fiheon Imroze, Calum Rose, Wridhdhisom Karar, Manoj Stanley, Hadi Heidari, Nick M. Ridler, Martin Weides</p>
            <p>Quantum processors have the potential to revolutionise computing on a scale unseen since the development of semiconductor technology in the middle of the 20th century. However, while there is now huge activity and investment in the field, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome before the technology can be fully realised. Of primary concern is the development of the classical technology required to interface with quantum systems, as we push towards a new era of high-performance, large-scale quantum computing.   In this review, we briefly discuss some of the main challenges facing the development of universally useful quantum computers and the different architectures being investigated. We are primarily concerned with cryogenic quantum systems. These systems are among the most mature quantum computing architectures to date, and are garnering a lot of both industrial and academic attention.   We present and analyse the leading methods of interfacing with quantum processors, both now and for the next generation of larger, multi-qubit systems. Recent advancements in control cryoelectronics, both semiconducting and superconducting, are covered, while a view towards newer methods such as optical and wireless qubit interfaces are also presented.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05653v2" target="_blank">How communities shape epidemic spreading: A hierarchically structured   metapopulation perspective</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyang Qian, Malbor Asllani</p>
            <p>Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, and influenza have renewed interest in advancing epidemic models to better reflect the complexities of disease spreading. Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility patterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay between social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic propagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where individuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools, workplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field averaging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean connectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for infection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral perturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and amplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are not only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing epidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation theory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are shaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian eigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between community infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector -- revealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection patterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and predicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the fundamental role of community organization.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18516v1" target="_blank">Highly Accurate Expectation Values Using High-Order Relativistic Coupled   Cluster Theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriele Fabbro, Jan Brandejs, Trond Saue</p>
            <p>This work presents the automatic generation of analytic first derivatives of the energy for general coupled-cluster models using the \text{tenpi} toolchain. We report the first implementation of expectation values for CCSDT and CCSDTQ methods within the DIRAC program package for relativistic molecular calculations. As pivotal calculations, we focus on the electric field gradient (EFG) evaluated at the lithium nucleus in LiX (X = H, F, Cl) compounds, enabling the extraction of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment $Q({}^{7}Li)$, and at the aluminum nucleus in AlY (Y =H, F, Cl, Br) compounds, for the determination of $Q({}^{27}Al)$. These high-order methods are applied to compute corrections for triple and quadruple excitations for the EFG, a crucial quantity for determining nuclear quadrupole moments. We obtain $Q({}^{27}Al)$ = 0.1466 b, in excellent agreement with the recommended value, and $Q({}^{7}Li)$ = -0.0386 b, which is smaller than the currently recommended value, that indicates the need for further investigation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18514v1" target="_blank">Inflationary background renormalization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Kristiano, Jun'ichi Yokoyama</p>
            <p>In cosmic inflation, non-linearities of the curvature perturbation can induce backreaction to the background. To obtain observational predictions at non-linear order on the correct background, one has to redefine the background or introduce background renormalization. We explicitly demonstrate it with a vanishing one-point function of the curvature perturbation as a renormalization condition, so that proper observational predictions can be made even at the nonlinear level. Due to non-linear symmetry of the curvature perturbation, such a procedure induces corrections to the two-point functions, which yield a finite renormalized one-loop correction that depends on the regularization scheme. Cancellation of the divergence is a manifestation of Maldacena's consistency condition. The finite term can be large and highly time-dependent, which indicates evolution outside the horizon.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18513v1" target="_blank">PODNO: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zilan Cheng, Zhongjian Wang, Li-Lian Wang, Mejdi Azaiez</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators (PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse) orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis, the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18512v1" target="_blank">Atoms in hollow-core fibers: A QED approach</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas W. Clark, Luca Vincetti, Peter Domokos</p>
            <p>We outline mechanical effects of light-matter interaction inside hollow-core optical fibers. Starting with quantized electromagnetic radiation, we demonstrate how dispersion, mode functions and losses define an open quantum system and how subsequent Langevin equations can be used to predict spatially-dependent vacuum forces. Conceptually, we reveal new, geometry-induced, forces that have no equivalence in unbounded 3-D space and, practically, show how the general spatial dependence can be greatly approximated by free-space Ince-Gaussian modes: such that the forces can be described analytically. By also considering the effects of drive and fluctuations, we provide an extensive overview of both control and cooling within the limitations of a 2-level atomic system.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02748v2" target="_blank">Intertwined order of generalized global symmetries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Moy, Eduardo Fradkin</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions in a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend this lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18506v1" target="_blank">Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path   Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p>
