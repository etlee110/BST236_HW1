            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10488v1" target="_blank">Independent connection in ACTion during inflation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Salvio</p>
            <p>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ATC) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. The role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is also briefly discussed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10486v1" target="_blank">DNF-Avatar: Distilling Neural Fields for Real-time Animatable Avatar   Relighting</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeren Jiang, Shaofei Wang, Siyu Tang</p>
            <p>Creating relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular videos is a rising research topic with a range of applications, e.g. virtual reality, sports, and video games. Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10484v1" target="_blank">Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String   Backgrounds</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Braeger, Vivek Chakrabhavi, Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner</p>
            <p>String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</p>

            <p>Neutrino oscillations constitute an excellent tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the \ess experiment to constrain the effects of flavour-dependent long-range forces (LRFs) in neutrino oscillations, which may arise due to the extension of the Standard Model gauge group by introducing new $U(1)$ symmetries. Focusing on three specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\mu$, $L_e - L_\tau$, and $L_\mu - L_\tau$, we demonstrate that \ess offers a favourable environment to search for LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that \ess can set 90\% confidence level bounds of $V_{e\mu} < 2.99 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, $V_{e\tau} < 2.05 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, and $V_{\mu\tau} < 1.81 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic uncertainties from $5\%$ to $2\%$ improves the \ess limits on $V_{\alpha\beta}$. Interestingly, we find limited correlations between LRF parameters and the less constrained lepton mixing parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$, preserving the robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP violation. Even under extreme LRF potentials ($V_{\alpha\beta} \gg 10^{-13} \, \text{eV}$), the CP-violation sensitivity and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ precision remain largely unaffected. These results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive experimental setup for probing LRF effects, complementing constraints from other neutrino sources and offering critical insights into the physics of long-range forces.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10477v1" target="_blank">Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arko Bhaumik, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Anish Ghoshal</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}>-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f>f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is found to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10476v1" target="_blank">Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anil Bilgin, Ian N. Hammock, Alexander A. High, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04663v2" target="_blank">On pattern formation in the thermodynamically-consistent variational   Gray-Scott model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenrui Hao, Chun Liu, Yiwei Wang, Yahong Yang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore pattern formation in a four-species variational Gary-Scott model, which includes all reverse reactions and introduces a virtual species to describe the birth-death process in the classical Gray-Scott model. This modification transforms the classical Gray-Scott model into a thermodynamically consistent closed system. The classical two-species Gray-Scott model can be viewed as a subsystem of the variational model in the limiting case when the small parameter $\epsilon$, related to the reaction rate of the reverse reactions, approaches zero. We numerically explore pattern formation in this physically more complete Gray-Scott model in one spatial dimension, using non-uniform steady states of the classical model as initial conditions. By decreasing $\epsilon$, we observed that the stationary pattern in the classical Gray-Scott model can be stabilized as the transient state in the variational model for a significantly small $\epsilon$. Additionally, the variational model admits oscillating and traveling-wave-like patterns for small $\epsilon$. The persistent time of these patterns is on the order of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. We also analyze the energy stability of two uniform steady states in the variational Gary-Scott model for fixed $\epsilon$. Although both states are stable in a certain sense, the gradient flow type dynamics of the variational model exhibit a selection effect based on the initial conditions, with pattern formation occurring only if the initial condition does not converge to the boundary steady state, which corresponds to the trivial uniform steady state in the classical Gray-Scott model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14558v3" target="_blank">Thermal quantum information capacity in a topological insulator</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida</p>
            <p>Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10475v1" target="_blank">Probing the Sivers Asymmetry with Transverse Energy-Energy Correlators   in the Small-$x$ Regime</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shohini Bhattacharya, Zhong-Bo Kang, Diego Padilla, Jani Penttala</p>
            <p>We investigate transverse energy-energy correlators (TEECs) for both polarized and unpolarized targets in the small-$x$ regime at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of a hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape observables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This allows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a C-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the charge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we restrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively charged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC Sivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on the $0.1 \%$ level. This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the still largely unconstrained odderon amplitude.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10474v1" target="_blank">Co-optimizing Physical Reconfiguration Parameters and Controllers for an   Origami-inspired Reconfigurable Manipulator</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Chen, Li Chen, Hao Zhang, Jianguo Zhao</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable robots that can change their physical configuration post-fabrication have demonstrate their potential in adapting to different environments or tasks. However, it is challenging to determine how to optimally adjust reconfigurable parameters for a given task, especially when the controller depends on the robot's configuration. In this paper, we address this problem using a tendon-driven reconfigurable manipulator composed of multiple serially connected origami-inspired modules as an example. Under tendon actuation, these modules can achieve different shapes and motions, governed by joint stiffnesses (reconfiguration parameters) and the tendon displacements (control inputs). We leverage recent advances in co-optimization of design and control for robotic system to treat reconfiguration parameters as design variables and optimize them using reinforcement learning techniques. We first establish a forward model based on the minimum potential energy method to predict the shape of the manipulator under tendon actuations. Using the forward model as the environment dynamics, we then co-optimize the control policy (on the tendon displacements) and joint stiffnesses of the modules for goal reaching tasks while ensuring collision avoidance. Through co-optimization, we obtain optimized joint stiffness and the corresponding optimal control policy to enable the manipulator to accomplish the task that would be infeasible with fixed reconfiguration parameters (i.e., fixed joint stiffness). We envision the co-optimization framework can be extended to other reconfigurable robotic systems, enabling them to optimally adapt their configuration and behavior for diverse tasks and environments.</p>
