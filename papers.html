            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03351v5" target="_blank">Unsupervised Super-Resolution Data Assimilation Using Conditional   Variational Autoencoders with Estimating Background Covariances via   Super-Resolution</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Yasuda, Ryo Onishi</p>
            <p>This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We derive an evidence lower bound for unsupervised learning, showing that our theory is an extension of a traditional data assimilation (DA) method, namely the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. In contrast to 3D-Var, our theory exploits the non-locality of super-resolution (SR) to learn background covariances without explicitly imposing them for assimilating distant observations. For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance matrices,whereas for nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks induces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can naturally be realized with CVAEs because the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By incorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution forecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator by reconstructing the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated superior accuracy in HR inference. SRDA was also computationally efficient because it does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrating SR and DA, which will stimulate further research in this direction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01402v4" target="_blank">Noncommutative quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikola Herceg, Tajron Jurić, A. Naveena Kumara, Andjelo Samsarov, Ivica Smolić</p>
            <p>We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12291v1" target="_blank">Liouvillean Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying</p>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12290v1" target="_blank">Diffeomorphism in Closed String Field Theory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Mazel, Charles Wang, Xi Yin</p>
            <p>We explain how the spacetime diffeomorphism in the classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT) is represented as $L_\infty$ gauge transformations in weakly curved backgrounds. In particular, we demonstrate the explicit map between covariant spacetime fields and the string fields in the flat-vertex frame to the leading few orders in perturbation theory. We further consider a Batalin-Vilkovisky system of extended string fields that manifests diffeomorphism invariance and allows for extending certain perturbative SFT solutions to the large field regime.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12289v1" target="_blank">A finite Carrollian critical point</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Cotler, Prateksh Dhivakar, Kristan Jensen</p>
            <p>We construct examples of renormalizable Carrollian theories with finite effective central charge and non-trivial dynamics. These include critical points that are not scale-invariant but rather exhibit hyperscaling violation. All of our examples are mildly non-Lagrangian, in that they arise from suitable $N\to 0$ limits of Carrollian theories with $N$-component fields, including limits of Carrollian vector models and non-abelian gauge theories. We discuss implications for flat space holography, highlighting challenges in realizing Carrollian duals to gravitational theories.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12286v1" target="_blank">Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dung N. Pham, Zoe Zager, Wentao Fan, Hakan E. Türeci</p>
            <p>We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12842v2" target="_blank">Impossibility of Quantum Private Queries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esther Hänggi, Severin Winkler</p>
            <p>Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12283v1" target="_blank">How Accidental was Inflation?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignatios Antoniadis, John Ellis, Wenqi Ke, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos, Keith A. Olive</p>
            <p>Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value, threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation, leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of $10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation' parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values, thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12282v1" target="_blank">Quantum Area Fluctuations from Gravitational Phase Space</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Ciambelli, Temple He, Kathryn M. Zurek</p>
            <p>We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism and derive the relevant quantum commutators by inverting the symplectic form and quantizing. Finally, we compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime, and derive the relationship $\langle (\Delta A)^2 \rangle \geq \frac{2\pi G}{d}\langle A \rangle$, showing that the variance of the area fluctuations is proportional to the area itself.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12280v1" target="_blank">On the range of validity of parabolic models for fluid flow through   isotropic homogeneous porous media</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Dapelo, Stephan Simonis, Mohaddeseh Mousavi Nezhad, Mathias J. Krause, John Bridgeman</p>
            <p>Lattice-Boltzmann methods are established mesoscopic numerical schemes for fluid flow, that recover the evolution of macroscopic quantities (viz., velocity and pressure fields) evolving under macroscopic target equations. The approximated target equations for fluid flows are typically parabolic and include a (weak) compressibility term. A number of Lattice-Boltzmann models targeting, or making use of, flow through porous media in the representative elementary volume, have been successfully developed. However, apart from two exceptions, the target equations are not reported, or the assumptions for and approximations of these equations are not fully clarified. Within this work, the underlying assumption underpinning parabolic equations for porous flow in the representative elementary volume, are discussed, clarified and listed. It is shown that the commonly-adopted assumption of negligible hydraulic dispersion is not justifiable by clear argument - and in fact, that by not adopting it, one can provide a qualitative and quantitative expression for the effective viscosity in the Brinkman correction of Darcy law. Finally, it is shown that, under certain conditions, it is possible to interpret porous models as Euler-Euler multiphase models wherein one phase is the solid matrix.</p>
