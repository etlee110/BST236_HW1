            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariona Badenas-Agusti, Siyi Xu, Andrew Vanderburg, Kishalay De, Patrick Dufour, Laura K. Rogers, Susana Hoyos, Simon Blouin, Javier Viaña, Amy Bonsor, Ben Zuckerman</p>
            <p>We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06225v1" target="_blank">Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergii Parchenko, Peter M. Oppeneer, Andreas Scherz</p>
            <p>Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07997v2" target="_blank">Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Botao Du, Qihao Guo, Santiago López, Ruichao Ma</p>
            <p>We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06223v1" target="_blank">A Proton Treatment Planning Method for Combining FLASH and Spatially   Fractionated Radiation Therapy to Enhance Normal Tissue Protection</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijie Zhang, Xue Hong, Ya-Nan Zhu, Yuting Lin, Gregory Gan, Ronald C Chen, Hao Gao</p>
            <p>Background: FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) uses ultra-high dose rates to induce the FLASH effect, enhancing normal tissue sparing. In proton Bragg peak FLASH-RT, this effect is confined to high-dose regions near the target at deep tissue levels. In contrast, Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) creates alternating high- and low-dose regions with high peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR), sparing tissues at shallow-to-intermediate depths. Purpose: This study investigates a novel proton modality (SFRT-FLASH) that synergizes FLASH-RT and SFRT to enhance normal tissue protection across all depths. Methods: Two SFRT techniques are integrated with FLASH-RT: proton GRID therapy (pGRID) with conventional beam sizes and proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) with submillimeter beams. These are implemented as pGRID-FLASH (SB-FLASH) and minibeam-FLASH (MB-FLASH), respectively. The pGRID technique uses a scissor-beam (SB) method to achieve uniform target coverage. To meet FLASH dose (5 Gy) and dose-rate (40 Gy/s) thresholds, a single-field uniform-dose-per-fraction strategy is used. Dose and dose-rate constraints are jointly optimized, including a CTV1cm structure (a 1 cm ring around the CTV) for each field. Results: Across four clinical cases, MB-FLASH and SB-FLASH plans were benchmarked against conventional (CONV), FLASH-RT (FLASH), pMBRT (MB), and pGRID (SB) plans. SFRT-FLASH achieved high FLASH effect coverage (~60-80% in CTV1cm) while preserving PVDR (~2.5-7) at shallow-to-intermediate depths. Conclusions: We present a proton treatment planning approach that combines the FLASH effect at depth with high PVDR near the surface, enhancing normal tissue protection and advancing proton therapy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06220v1" target="_blank">Hamiltonian formalism for non-diagonalisable systems of hydrodynamic   type</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Lorenzoni, Sara Perletti, Karoline van Gemst</p>
            <p>We study the system of first order PDEs for pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalisation of this result to a class of non-diagonalisable systems of hydrodynamic type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06218v1" target="_blank">Let Humanoids Hike! Integrative Skill Development on Complex Trails</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwan-Yee Lin, Stella X. Yu</p>
            <p>Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06216v1" target="_blank">Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation   within the quantum singular value transformation framework</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasushi Yoneta</p>
            <p>Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, a variety of ensembles have been devised, including not only the Gibbs ensembles, such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, but also various generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. We show that selecting an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06212v1" target="_blank">From Fermions to Qubits: A ZX-Calculus Perspective</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haytham McDowall-Rose, Razin A. Shaikh, Lia Yeh</p>
            <p>Mapping fermionic systems to qubits on a quantum computer is often the first step for algorithms in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. However, it is difficult to reconcile the many different approaches that have been proposed, such as those based on binary matrices, ternary trees, and stabilizer codes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the many ways to describe them -- transformation of Majorana operators, action on Fock states, encoder circuits, and stabilizers of local encodings -- making it challenging to know when the mappings are equivalent. In this work, we present a graphical framework for fermion-to-qubit mappings that streamlines and unifies various representations through the ZX-calculus.   To start, we present the correspondence between linear encodings of the Fock basis and phase-free ZX-diagrams. The commutation rules of scalable ZX-calculus allows us to convert the fermionic operators to Pauli operators under any linear encoding. Next, we give a translation from ternary tree mappings to scalable ZX-diagrams, which not only directly represents the encoder map as a CNOT circuit, but also retains the same structure as the tree. Consequently, we graphically prove that ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear encodings, a recent result by Chiew et al. The scalable ZX representation moreover enables us to construct an algorithm to directly compute the binary matrix for any ternary tree mapping. Lastly, we present the graphical representation of local fermion-to-qubit encodings. Its encoder ZX-diagram has the same connectivity as the interaction graph of the fermionic Hamiltonian and also allows us to easily identify stabilizers of the encoding.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06211v1" target="_blank">Alternating Methods for Large-Scale AC Optimal Power Flow with Unit   Commitment</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Brun, Thomas Lee, Dirk Lauinger, Xin Chen, Xu Andy Sun</p>
            <p>Security-constrained unit commitment with alternating current optimal power flow (SCUC-ACOPF) is a central problem in power grid operations that optimizes commitment and dispatch of generators under a physically accurate power transmission model while encouraging robustness against component failures. SCUC-ACOPF requires solving large-scale problems that involve multiple time periods and networks with thousands of buses within strict time limits. In this work, we study a detailed SCUC-ACOPF model with a rich set of features of modern power grids, including price-sensitive load, reserve products, transformer controls, and energy-limited devices. We propose a decomposition scheme and a penalty alternating direction method to find high-quality solutions to this model. Our methodology leverages spatial and temporal decomposition, separating the problem into a set of mixed-integer linear programs for each bus and a set of continuous nonlinear programs for each time period. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we introduce a variety of heuristics, including restrictions of temporal linking constraints, a second-order cone relaxation, and a contingency screening algorithm. We quantify the quality of feasible solutions through a dual bound from a convex second-order cone program. To evaluate our algorithm, we use large-scale test cases from Challenge 3 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Optimization Competition that resemble real power grid data under a variety of operating conditions and decision horizons. The experiments yield feasible solutions with an average optimality gap of 1.33%, demonstrating that this approach generates near-optimal solutions within stringent time limits.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15792v3" target="_blank">Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Li, Mohamed Al Begaowe, Shu Zhang, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</p>
