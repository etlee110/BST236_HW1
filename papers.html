            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17014v1" target="_blank">Emergent Gravity from Topological Quantum Field Theory: Stochastic   Gradient Flow Perspective away from the Quantum Gravity Problem</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Addazi, Salvatore Capozziello, Jinglong Liu, Antonino Marciano, Giuseppe Meluccio, Xuan-Lin Su</p>
            <p>We propose a scenario according to which the ultraviolet completion of General Relativity is realized through a stochastic gradient flow towards a topological BF theory. Specifically, we consider the stochastic gradient flow of a pre-geometric theory proposed by Wilczek. Its infrared limit exists, and corresponds to a fixed point where stochastic fluctuations vanish. Diffeomorphism symmetries are restored in this limit, where the theory is classical and expressed by the Einstein-Hilbert action. The infrared phase then corresponds to the classical theory of General Relativity, the quantization of which becomes meaningless. Away from the infrared limit, in the pre-geometric phase of the stochastic gradient flow, the relevant fields of the Wilczek theory undergo stochastic fluctuations. The theory can be quantized perturbatively, generating corrections to the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. The stochastic gradient flow also possesses an ultraviolet fixed point. The theory flows to a topological BF action, to which general non-perturbative quantization methods can be applied. Two phase transitions occur along the thermal time dynamics, being marked by: i) the breakdown of the topological BF symmetries in the ultraviolet regime, which originates the pre-geometric phase described by the Wilczek theory; ii) the breakdown of the parental symmetries characterizing the Wilczek theory, from which General Relativity emerges. The problem of quantizing the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity finally becomes redundant.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17009v1" target="_blank">Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard   Quantum Simulator</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Su, Rahul Sahay, Michal Szurek, Alexander Douglas, Ognjen Markovic, Ceren B. Dag, Ruben Verresen, Markus Greiner</p>
            <p>Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17007v1" target="_blank">Broadband Search for Axion Dark Matter via Shift Current</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Kondo, Takahiro Morimoto, Genta Osaki, Thanaporn Sichanugrist</p>
            <p>We propose a novel method to detect axion dark matter based on a topological phenomenon known as the shift current. We exploit the second-order nonlinearity of the shift current by applying a strong oscillating electric field. This field enhances the axion-induced shift current signal and downconverts its frequency to a more accessible range. The non-dissipative nature of the shift current allows us to achieve broadband detection via difference frequency generation. We demonstrate, using Type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs property, the possibility of probing the parameter space of the QCD axion in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ - $\mathcal{O}(100) \ \rm meV$ corresponding to the photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq$ $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})~\text{GeV}^{-1}$, respectively.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16999v1" target="_blank">Nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric transport from quantum geometry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Fang, Shouvik Sur, Yonglong Xie, Qimiao Si</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry may enable the development of quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to correlated topological states. One powerful probe of quantum geometry is the nonlinear Hall response which detects Berry curvature dipole in systems with time-reversal invariance and broken inversion symmetry. With broken time-reversal symmetry, this response is also associated with quantum metric dipole. Here we investigate nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric responses, which provide a wealth of new information about quantum geometry. In particular, we uncover a web of connections between these quantities that parallel the standard Wiedemann-Franz and Mott relations. Implications for the studies of a variety of topological systems, including Weyl-Kondo semimetals and Bernal bilayer graphene, are discussed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16996v1" target="_blank">A Unified Framework for Simultaneous Parameter and Function Discovery in   Differential Equations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shalev Manor, Mohammad Kohandel</p>
            <p>Inverse problems involving differential equations often require identifying unknown parameters or functions from data. Existing approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) and Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (UPINNs), are effective at isolating either parameters or functions but can face challenges when applied simultaneously due to solution non-uniqueness. In this work, we introduce a framework that addresses these limitations by establishing conditions under which unique solutions can be guaranteed. To illustrate, we apply it to examples from biological systems and ecological dynamics, demonstrating accurate and interpretable results. Our approach significantly enhances the potential of machine learning techniques in modeling complex systems in science and engineering.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16992v1" target="_blank">PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for   Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandra Franz, Hao Wei, Luca Guastoni, Nils Thuerey</p>
            <p>Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16989v1" target="_blank">Spin adaptation of the cumulant expansions of reduced density matrices</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Liebert, Christian Schilling, David A. Mazziotti</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic framework for the spin adaptation of the cumulants of p-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs), with explicit constructions for p = 1 to 3. These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S_z and S^2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation -- referred to as complete S-representability -- can be enforced by constraining the variances of S_z and S^2, which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size -- size-extensive -- making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods (DFT), one-particle RDM functional theories (RDMFT), and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin-orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16982v1" target="_blank">Beyond Correlation: Towards Causal Large Language Model Agents in   Biomedicine</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adib Bazgir, Amir Habibdoust Lafmajani, Yuwen Zhang</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to develop reliable AI partners for biomedical progress.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16971v1" target="_blank">UniPhy: Learning a Unified Constitutive Model for Inverse Physics   Simulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himangi Mittal, Peiye Zhuang, Hsin-Ying Lee, Shubham Tulsiani</p>
            <p>We propose UniPhy, a common latent-conditioned neural constitutive model that can encode the physical properties of diverse materials. At inference UniPhy allows `inverse simulation' i.e. inferring material properties by optimizing the scene-specific latent to match the available observations via differentiable simulation. In contrast to existing methods that treat such inference as system identification, UniPhy does not rely on user-specified material type information. Compared to prior neural constitutive modeling approaches which learn instance specific networks, the shared training across materials improves both, robustness and accuracy of the estimates. We train UniPhy using simulated trajectories across diverse geometries and materials -- elastic, plasticine, sand, and fluids (Newtonian & non-Newtonian). At inference, given an object with unknown material properties, UniPhy can infer the material properties via latent optimization to match the motion observations, and can then allow re-simulating the object under diverse scenarios. We compare UniPhy against prior inverse simulation methods, and show that the inference from UniPhy enables more accurate replay and re-simulation under novel conditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06160v2" target="_blank">Quantum response theory and momentum-space gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Mehraeen</p>
            <p>We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</p>
