            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10387v1" target="_blank">Unconventional Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body   Scars</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Morettini, Luca Capizzi, Maurizio Fagotti, Leonardo Mazza</p>
            <p>We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional form of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport; counterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the aforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10386v1" target="_blank">Gapping the spin-nodal planes of an anisotropic p-wave magnet to induce   a large anomalous Hall effect</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinsuke Yamada, Max T. Birch, Priya R. Baral, Shun Okumura, Ryota Nakano, Shang Gao, Yuki Ishihara, Kamil K. Kolincio, Ilya Belopolski, Hajime Sagayama, Hironori Nakao, Kazuki Ohishi, Taro Nakajima, Yoshinori Tokura, Taka-hisa Arima, Yukitoshi Motome, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Max Hirschberger</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}>600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $>3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10384v1" target="_blank">Scaling limit and tail bounds for a random walk model of SOS level lines</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milind Hegde, Yujin H. Kim, Christian Serio</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes a random walk model for the level lines appearing in the entropic repulsion phenomena of three-dimensional discrete random interfaces above a hard wall; we are particularly motivated by the low-temperature (2+1)D solid-on-solid (SOS) model, where the emergence of these level lines has been rigorously established. The model we consider is a line ensemble of non-crossing random walk bridges above a wall with geometrically growing area tilts. Our main result, which in particular resolves a question of Caputo, Ioffe, and Wachtel (2019), is an edge 1:2:3 scaling limit for this ensemble as the domain size $N$ diverges, with a growing number of walks (including the number of level lines of the SOS model) and high boundary conditions (covering the maximum upper deviation of the SOS level lines). As a key input, we establish Tracy--Widom-type upper tail bounds for each of the relevant curves in the line ensemble. An ingredient which may be of independent interest is a ballot theorem for random walk bridges under a broader range of boundary values than available in the literature.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13900v2" target="_blank">The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Alonso-Lobo, Gabriel G. Carlo, F. Borondo</p>
            <p>Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. This includes the presence of scarring on unstable periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10375v1" target="_blank">Scalar weak gravity bound from full unitarity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Tokareva, Yongjun Xu</p>
            <p>Weak gravity conjecture can be formulated as a statement that gravity must be the weakest force, compared to the other interactions in low energy effective field theory (EFT). Several arguments in favor of this statement were presented from the side of string theory and black hole physics. However, it is still an open question whether the statement of weak gravity can be proven based on more general assumptions of causality, unitarity, and locality of the fundamental theory. These consistency requirements imply the dispersion relations for the scattering amplitudes which allow to bound the EFT coefficients. The main difficulty for obtaining these constraints in the presence of gravity is related to the graviton pole which makes the required dispersion relations divergent in the forward limit. In this work, we present a new way of deriving the bound on the ratio between the EFT cutoff scale and Planck mass from confronting the IR divergences from graviton pole and one-loop running of the EFT Wilson coefficient in front of the dimension-12 operator. Our method also allows the incorporation of full unitarity of partial wave expansion of the UV theory. We examine the EFT of a single shift-symmetric scalar in four dimensions and find that the maximal value of the cutoff scale of the EFT coupled to gravity must be lower than about $O(10)$ Planck mass.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01903v2" target="_blank">Open-Source Benchtop Magnetophotometer (MAP) for Characterizing the   Magnetic Susceptibility of Nanoparticles</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Scholtz, Jack Paulson, Victoria Nunez, Andrea M. Armani</p>
            <p>Magnetic nanoparticles form the foundation of many biomedical and environmental technologies. Although various methods exist to characterize a subset of physical properties of nanoparticles, measuring their magnetic response remains challenging. This property is defined by magnetic susceptibility, which describes how a material responds to an external magnetic field. However, accurately measuring magnetic susceptibility relies on specialized, high-performance instrumentation which require large quantities of dried sample. Here, we present the design and validation of an open-source benchtop instrument, a magnetophotometer (MAP), which non-destructively measures the magnetic susceptibility of suspended nanoparticles via monochromatic differential optical spectroscopy. To validate the system's accuracy, a series of measurements are performed, and results from a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) serve as a benchmark. First, a series of three iron oxide nanoparticle batches was synthesized with distinctly different susceptibility values, and the MAP successfully differentiates between them in agreement with SQUID results. Notably, in comparison with the SQUID, the MAP requires an order of magnitude less sample and obtains a result 99.8% faster. To demonstrate utility in the biomedical field, the MAP performs non-destructive analysis of bioconjugated magnetic nanoparticles, a measurement that is not possible using currently available commercial systems. The bioactivity of the surface coating is not degraded by the testing, and the susceptibility values are in agreement with the particle material. Thus, the MAP provides a path for in-line rapid quality control assessment of nanoparticles in their final application environment.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10372v1" target="_blank">Microstates of AdS$_5$ black holes with hypermultiplets</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina David, Annelien Vekemans</p>
            <p>We construct supersymmetric rotating AdS$_5$ black holes in 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets and a universal hypermultiplet, and verify their microscopic counting from the superconformal index of the dual 4d class $\mathcal{S}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs. From the CFT, we perform the Legendre transform of the index to the microcanonical ensemble. The theories are parametrized by a rational number $z$ which enters into the extremization equations making them more challenging to solve. We present a method to address these difficulties and highlight the subtleties involved. From the gravity perspective, we identify a charged, rotating black hole whose Bekenstein-Hawking entropy matches the prediction from the index for $z=\pm1$. Beyond this value, where hypermultiplet scalars are nonzero, we construct the near-horizon extremal geometry perturbatively around $z= 1$ and verify that the entropy is consistent with the CFT prediction. We discuss the thermodynamics and verify the near-horizon versions of the first law of thermodynamics and the supersymmetric condition. In this setting, our analysis characterizes the first construction of a rotating black hole geometry in a 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theory that contains hypermultiplets.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00604v3" target="_blank">Radar shielding experiments by composite bilayer magnetic systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaume Calvo-de la Rosa, Jesús López-Sánchez, Joan Manel Hernàndez, Pilar Marín, Javier Tejada</p>
            <p>An experimental strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% is measured in a set of novel functional bilayer systems. We focus our work on studying the samples in an anechoic chamber under far-field real radar conditions. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with random anisotropy hexaferrite and soft metallic materials (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a submillimetric bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer permittivity, permeability, and thickness leading, therefore, to a strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09495v3" target="_blank">The Fuzzball Paradigm</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samir D. Mathur, Madhur Mehta</p>
            <p>We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the classical horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10368v1" target="_blank">Generalised Process Theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John H. Selby, Maria E. Stasinou, Matt Wilson, Bob Coecke</p>
            <p>Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</p>
