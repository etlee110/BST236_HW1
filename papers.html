            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00199v3" target="_blank">Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob M. Hiesener, C. Alex Kaylor, Joshua J. Wong, Prankush Agarwal, Stephen E. Ralph</p>
            <p>We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06369v3" target="_blank">Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erick Arguello Cruz, Igor R. Klebanov, Grigory Tarnopolsky, Yuan Xin</p>
            <p>The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d<6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalization, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04223v1" target="_blank">Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees   and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Ralli, Tim Weaving, Peter V. Coveney, Peter J. Love</p>
            <p>In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04221v1" target="_blank">Topological Mixed States: Axiomatic Approaches and Phases of Matter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \emph{mixed-state bootstrap program}.   From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04212v1" target="_blank">Studying mirror acceleration via kinetic simulations of relativistic   plasma turbulence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saikat Das, Siyao Xu, Joonas Nättilä</p>
            <p>Efficient turbulent acceleration of particles is indicated by recent astrophysical observations, but its mechanism is not well understood. Mirror acceleration has recently been proposed as an efficient mechanism for particle energization in turbulence-compressed magnetic fields. We employ a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of pair plasma in magnetized and relativistic turbulence to study this new mechanism and its acceleration efficiency. By tracking individual particles, we see that reversal of a particle's moving direction and significant energy gain can happen during one mirror interaction and within one gyro-orbit. As expected for mirror acceleration, we statistically find that (1) energy gain is preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field and positively correlated with local magnetic field strengthening, and (2) the particle pitch angle distribution becomes increasingly anisotropic toward higher energies, with a concentration at large pitch angles. Our results demonstrate that the mirror acceleration causes a strong confinement of particles by stochastically increasing their pitch angles. This, in turn, facilitates repeated mirror acceleration with the mirroring condition well satisfied. We conclude that mirror acceleration is a promising mechanism accounting for efficient acceleration in magnetized and turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13302v2" target="_blank">Multi-Mode Global Driving of Trapped Ions for Quantum Circuit Synthesis</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Richerme</p>
            <p>We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $n-$body interactions between any subset $n$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01886v3" target="_blank">Generalized Statistics on Lattice</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Yuyang Li, Hanyu Xue, Po-Shen Hsin, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04200v1" target="_blank">Entanglement renormalization circuits for $2d$ Gaussian Fermion States</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sing Lam Wong, Andrew C. Potter</p>
            <p>The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04197v1" target="_blank">Transportation cost and contraction coefficient for channels on von   Neumann algebras</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roy Araiza, Marius Junge, Peixue Wu</p>
            <p>We present a noncommutative optimal transport framework for quantum channels acting on von Neumann algebras. Our central object is the Lipschitz cost measure, a transportation-inspired quantity that evaluates the minimal cost required to move between quantum states via a given channel. Accompanying this is the Lipschitz contraction coefficient, which captures how much the channel contracts the Wasserstein-type distance between states. We establish foundational properties of these quantities, including continuity, dual formulations, and behavior under composition and tensorization. Applications include recovery of several mathematical quantities including expected group word length and Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance, via transportation cost. Moreover, we show that if the Lipschitz contraction coefficient is strictly less than one, one can get entropy contraction and mixing time estimates for certain classes of non-symmetric channels.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16989v2" target="_blank">From Hamilton-Jacobi to Bohm: Why the Wave Function Isn't Just Another   Action</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaud Amblard, Aurélien Drezet</p>
            <p>This paper examines the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian mechanics (BM), addressing the debate between causal and nomological interpretations. While BM postulates particles with definite trajectories guided by the wave function, the ontological status of the wave function itself remains contested. Critics of the causal interpretation argue that the wave function's high-dimensionality and lack of back-reaction disqualify it as a physical entity. Proponents of the nomological interpretation, drawing parallels to the classical Hamiltonian, propose that the wave function is a "law-like" entity. However, this view faces challenges, including reliance on speculative quantum gravity frameworks (e.g., the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) and conceptual ambiguities about the nature of "nomological entities". By systematically comparing BM to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, this paper highlights disanalogies between the wave function and the classical action function. These differences, particularly the wave function's dynamical necessity and irreducibility, support a sui generis interpretation, where the wave function represents a novel ontological category unique to quantum theory. The paper concludes that the wave function's role in BM resists classical analogies, demanding a metaphysical framework that accommodates its non-local, high-dimensional, and dynamically irreducible nature.</p>
