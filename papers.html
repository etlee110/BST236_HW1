            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02880v1" target="_blank">A New $\sim 5σ$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1   and DES-SN5YR observations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A Sen</p>
            <p>We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08900v2" target="_blank">Accelerated Multi-Objective Alloy Discovery through Efficient Bayesian   Methods: Application to the FCC Alloy Space</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trevor Hastings, Mrinalini Mulukutla, Danial Khatamsaz, Daniel Salas, Wenle Xu, Daniel Lewis, Nicole Person, Matthew Skokan, Braden Miller, James Paramore, Brady Butler, Douglas Allaire, Vahid Attari, Ibrahim Karaman, George Pharr, Ankit Srivastava, Raymundo Arroyave</p>
            <p>This study introduces BIRDSHOT, an integrated Bayesian materials discovery framework designed to efficiently explore complex compositional spaces while optimizing multiple material properties. We applied this framework to the CoCrFeNiVAl FCC high entropy alloy (HEA) system, targeting three key performance objectives: ultimate tensile strength/yield strength ratio, hardness, and strain rate sensitivity. The experimental campaign employed an integrated cyber-physical approach that combined vacuum arc melting (VAM) for alloy synthesis with advanced mechanical testing, including tensile and high-strain-rate nanoindentation testing. By incorporating batch Bayesian optimization schemes that allowed the parallel exploration of the alloy space, we completed five iterative design-make-test-learn loops, identifying a non-trivial three-objective Pareto set in a high-dimensional alloy space. Notably, this was achieved by exploring only 0.15% of the feasible design space, representing a significant acceleration in discovery rate relative to traditional methods. This work demonstrates the capability of BIRDSHOT to navigate complex, multi-objective optimization challenges and highlights its potential for broader application in accelerating materials discovery.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16417v5" target="_blank">The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing   quantum phase transitions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.   However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan.   The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02869v1" target="_blank">Frequency domain identification for multivariable motion control   systems: Applied to a prototype wafer stage</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. van der Hulst, R. A. González, K. Classens, P. Tacx, N. Dirkx, J. van de Wijdeven, T. Oomen</p>
            <p>Multivariable parametric models are essential for optimizing the performance of high-tech systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop an identification strategy that provides accurate parametric models for complex multivariable systems. To achieve this, an additive model structure is adopted, offering advantages over traditional black-box model structures when considering physical systems. The introduced method minimizes a weighted least-squares criterion and uses an iterative linear regression algorithm to solve the estimation problem, achieving local optimality upon convergence. Experimental validation is conducted on a prototype wafer-stage system, featuring a large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibiting complex flexible dynamic behavior, to evaluate performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02867v1" target="_blank">Conservative Dynamics of Relativistic Binaries Beyond Einstein Gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Wilson-Gerow</p>
            <p>We study the conservative dynamics of spinless compact objects in a general effective theory of gravity which includes a metric and an arbitrary number of scalar fields, through $\mathcal{O}(G^{3})$. Departures from Einstein gravity, which preserve general coordinate and local Lorentz invariance, are characterized by higher-derivative terms in a Lagrangian whose coupling constants scale as powers of a ``new-physics'' length scale, $\ell$. For a purely metric theory we compute the contributions from the the leading and subleading higher-curvature curvature corrections. In four dimensions these are cubic and quartic curvature terms, i.e. orders $\ell^4$ and $\ell^6$. We also study a general multi-scalar-tensor theory of gravity to order $\ell^{4}$, which includes both Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) higher-order couplings. Specifically, we compute the radial action in a post-Minkowskian approximation for scattering orbits, to two-loop order. The result encodes the fully relativistic dynamics of the compact objects, and serves as a generating function for gauge-invariant orbital observables for both bound and unbound binary systems. Where overlapping post-Newtonian results are available, we've verified agreement.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08705v2" target="_blank">Beyond the Lens: Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Documentaries   through Amazon Reviews</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jill Naiman, Aria Pessianzadeh, Hanyu Zhao, AJ Christensen, Kalina Borkiewicz, Shriya Srikanth, Anushka Gami, Emma Maxwell, Louisa Zhang, Sri Nithya Yeragorla, Rezvaneh Rezapour</p>
            <p>Engaging the public with science is critical for a well-informed population. A popular method of scientific communication is documentaries. Once released, it can be difficult to assess the impact of such works on a large scale, due to the overhead required for in-depth audience feedback studies. In what follows, we overview our complementary approach to qualitative studies through quantitative impact and sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for several scientific documentaries. In addition to developing a novel impact category taxonomy for this analysis, we release a dataset containing 1296 human-annotated sentences from 1043 Amazon reviews for six movies created in whole or part by the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL). This interdisciplinary team is housed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and consists of visualization designers who focus on cinematic presentations of scientific data. Using this data, we train and evaluate several machine learning and large language models, discussing their effectiveness and possible generalizability for documentaries beyond those focused on for this work. Themes are also extracted from our annotated dataset which, along with our large language model analysis, demonstrate a measure of the ability of scientific documentaries to engage with the public.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12203v6" target="_blank">Vanishing Polyakov Loop for QCD with Twelve Massless Quarks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seth Grable, Paul Romatschke</p>
            <p>We consider continuum-formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(\(N\)) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well-developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly . The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a $\beta$-function that matches the known perturbative result in the high energy limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial saddle which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02860v1" target="_blank">PileUp Mitigation at the HL-LHC Using Attention for Event-Wide Context</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Vaughan, Mohammed Rakib, Shivang Patel, Flera Rizatdinova, Alexander Khanov, Arunkumar Bagavathi</p>
            <p>The Large Hadron Collider, LHC, collides bunches of protons resulting in multiple interactions that occur practically simultaneously. This creates a pileup effect that distorts physics measurements due to the products of pileup collisions. In order to improve the discovery potential of the LHC, it is necessary to mitigate the effect of pileup interactions on the processes of interest. In this paper, we suggest a novel AI-based method, PUMiNet, to tackle the problem of pileup at the current LHC and future High Luminosity LHC conditions. PUMiNet is an attention-based algorithm that mitigates pileup effects using a regression task on jets in the context of an entire event. At $\left\langle \mu \right\rangle=200$, PUMiNet is able to predict the hard scatter energy and mass fractions of jets with $R^2=0.912$ and $R^2=0.720$, respectively. These predictions enable the reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass in the HL-LHC environment.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02855v1" target="_blank">Four-point correlators with BPS bound states in AdS$_3$ and AdS$_5$</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Aprile, Stefano Giusto, Rodolfo Russo</p>
            <p>We consider heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) correlators in AdS/CFT, focussing on the D1D5 CFT$_2$ and the ${\cal N}= 4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Out of the lightest $1/2$-BPS operator in the spectrum, $O$, we construct a particular heavy operator $O_H$ given by a coherent superposition of multi-particle operators $O^n$, and study the HHLL correlator. When $n$ is of order of the central charge, we show that the bulk equation that computes our boundary HHLL correlators is always a Heun equation. By assuming that the form of the correlator can be continued to the regime where $n$ is ${\mathcal O}(1)$, we first reproduce the known single-particle four-point correlators for $n=1$ and then predict new results for the multi-particle correlators $\langle O^n O^n O O\rangle$. Explicit expressions can be written entirely in terms of $n$-loop ladder integrals and their derivatives, and we provide them for $n=2$ and $n=3$ both in position and in Mellin space. Focussing on the AdS$_5$ case, we study the OPE expansion of these multi-particle correlators and show that several consistency relations with known CFT data are non-trivially satisfied. Finally, we extract new CFT data for double and triple-particle long operators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19640v3" target="_blank">Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and   the K-identities</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Hong Lai, Jen-Chi Lee, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</p>
