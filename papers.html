            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02836v1" target="_blank">Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene   Generation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Ling, Chen-Hsuan Lin, Tsung-Yi Lin, Yifan Ding, Yu Zeng, Yichen Sheng, Yunhao Ge, Ming-Yu Liu, Aniket Bera, Zhaoshuo Li</p>
            <p>Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02837v1" target="_blank">Pauli crystal superradiance</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Ortuño-Gonzalez, Rui Lin, Justyna Stefaniak, Alexander Baumgärtner, Gabriele Natale, Tobias Donner, R. Chitra</p>
            <p>Pauli crystals are unique geometric structures of non-interacting fermions, resembling crystals, that emerge solely from Fermi statistics and confinement. Unlike genuine quantum crystals that arise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonetheless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in a cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli crystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied by the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically modulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The combined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus facilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02834v1" target="_blank">What is a Gaussian channel, and when is it physically implementable   using a multiport interferometer?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Repana Devendra, Tiju Cherian John, K. Sumesh</p>
            <p>Quantum Gaussian channels are fundamental models for communication and information processing in continuous-variable quantum systems. This work addresses both foundational aspects and physical implementation pathways for these channels. Firstly, we provide a rigorous, unified framework by formally proving the equivalence of three principal definitions of quantum Gaussian channels prevalent in the literature, consolidating theoretical understanding. Secondly, we investigate the physical realization of these channels using multiport interferometers, a key platform in quantum optics. The central research contribution is a precise characterization of the channel parameters that correspond to Gaussian channels physically implementable via linear optical multiport interferometers. This characterization bridges the abstract mathematical description with concrete physical architectures. Along the way, we also resolve some questions posed by Parthasarathy (Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 46, (2015)).</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02826v1" target="_blank">Statistical mechanical theory of liquid water</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshmanji Verma, Ken A. Dill</p>
            <p>Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08930v3" target="_blank">Time-adaptive phase estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brennan de Neeve, Andrey V. Lebedev, Vlad Negnevitsky, Jonathan P. Home</p>
            <p>Phase estimation is known to be a robust method for single-qubit gate calibration in quantum computers, while Bayesian estimation is widely used in devising optimal methods for learning in quantum systems. We present Bayesian phase estimation methods that adaptively choose a control phase and the time of coherent evolution based on prior phase knowledge. In the presence of noise, we find near-optimal performance with respect to known theoretical bounds, and demonstrate some robustness of the estimates to noise that is not accounted for in the model of the estimator, making the methods suitable for calibrating operations in quantum computers. We determine the utility of control parameter values using functions of the prior probability of the phase that quantify expected knowledge gain either in terms of expected narrowing of the posterior or expected information gain. In particular, we find that by maximising the rate of expected gain we obtain phase estimates having standard deviation a factor of 1.43 larger than the Heisenberg limit using a classical sequential strategy. The methods provide optimal solutions accounting for available prior knowledge and experimental imperfections with minimal effort from the user. The effect of many types of noise can be specified in the model of the measurement probabilities, and the rate of knowledge gain can easily be adjusted to account for times included in the measurement sequence other than the coherent evolution leading to the unknown phase, such as times required for state preparation or readout.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02821v1" target="_blank">High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Search with ABRACADABRA-10\,cm</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaliroë M. W. Pappas, Jessica T. Fry, Sabrina Cheng, Arianna Colón Cesaní, Jonathan L. Ouellet, Chiara P.

            <p>ABRACADABRA-10 cm has had great success as a pathfinder lumped-element axion dark matter experiment, setting limits on axion dark matter at the GUT scale. Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02817v1" target="_blank">Interacting massive/massless continuous-spin fields and integer-spin   fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. R. Metsaev</p>
            <p>In the framework of light-cone gauge approach, interacting continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields propagating in flat space are studied. The continuous-spin fields are considered by using the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation. Description of massive continuous-spin fields associated with the principal, complimentary and discrete series is presented. For the massive continuous-spin fields of the principal and supplementary series and massless continuous-spin fields, all parity-even cubic vertices realized as functions on vector superspace are obtained. Cubic vertices for cross-interaction of massive/massless continuous spin fields and massive/massless integer-spin fields are also derived. The use of the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation considerable simplifies cubic vertices as compared to the ones in the oscillator formulation. Some cubic vertices realized as distributions are also found. Map between the oscillator formulation and the vector superspace formulation of continuous-spin field is explicitly described. Equivalence of the light-cone gauge and Lorentz covariant formulations of continuous-spin field is also demonstrated.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02816v1" target="_blank">Exploring minimal two component doublet dark matter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariana Frank, Purusottam Ghosh, Chayan Majumdar, Supriya Senapati</p>
            <p>We propose a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario by extending the Standard Model with two additional $SU(2)_L$ doublets, one scalar, and another fermion. To ensure the stability of the DM components, we impose a global $Z_2 \times Z_2^\prime$ symmetry. The lightest neutral states for both the scalar and fermion, which are non-trivially transformed under the extended symmetry, behave as stable two-component DM candidates. While single components are under-abundant due to their gauge interactions, in a mass region between $m_W$ and $525$ GeV for the scalar and a mass below $1200$ GeV for the fermion, and the fermion DM conflicts with direct detection limits over the whole parameter space, having two components helps to saturate relic density in the regions with under-abundance. Compliance with direct detection constraints leads to two options, either introducing dim-5 effective operators, or embedding the scenarios into a complete UV theory, which reproduces a type-II seesaw model, thus naturally including neutrino masses. We analyze the consequences of this scenario at the LHC.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02814v1" target="_blank">Characterization of Gaussian Tensor Ensembles</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Remi Bonnin</p>
            <p>The starting point of this work is a theorem due to Maxwell characterizing the distribution of a Gaussian vector with at least two coordinates. We define the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Tensor Ensembles for notions of real symmetric, hermitian and self-dual hermitian tensors which recover the classical vector and matrix Gaussian Ensembles when the order is one and two. We give a basis of invariant polynomials for orthogonal, unitary and symplectic transformations and we prove a Maxwell-type theorem for these Gaussian tensor distributions unifying and extending the ones known for vectors and matrices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06509v2" target="_blank">Ultrafast and Directional Magnetization Control via Voltage-Controlled   Exchange Coupling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Jia, Yu-Chia Chen, Delin Zhang, Yang Lv, Shuang Liang, Onri Jay Benally, Yifei Yang, Brahmdutta Dixit, Deyuan Lyu, Brandon Zink, Jian-Ping Wang</p>
            <p>Ultrafast and energy-efficient electrically controlled magnetization switching is critical for next-generation spintronic devices. Voltage-driven switching offers an alternative to current-driven methods, significantly improving energy efficiency. Although voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) has been proposed to switch magnetic states, its ultrafast response has not been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate that VCEC induces a directional exchange field that persists under nanosecond voltage pulses in a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) with an exchange-coupled free layer. This establishes that VCEC can operate on ultrafast timescales with deterministic control over the switching polarity. The magnetization reversal is primarily assisted by voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), which transiently lowers the energy barrier. This combination enables magnetization switching within 87.5 ps with a 50% switching probability. The fast switching is attributed to enhanced magnetic relaxation of the free layer, facilitated by the exchange-coupled structure, which accelerates voltage-driven magnetization switching. These findings reveal that purely voltage-driven switching is viable for fast, bidirectional magnetization switching for future spintronic logic and memory technologies.</p>
