            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20994v1" target="_blank">Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and   time-varying tension</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anish Ghoshal, Filippo Revello, Gonzalo Villa</p>
            <p>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string cosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20990v1" target="_blank">Modification of the scattering mechanisms in bilayer graphene in   proximity to a molecular thin film probed in the mesoscopic regime</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anise Mansour, Deanna Diaz, Movindu Kawshan Dissanayake, Erin Henkhaus, Jungyoun Cho, Vinh Tran, Francisco Ramirez, Eric Corona-Oceguera, Joshua Luna, Kenta Kodama, Yueyun Chen, Ho Chan, Jacob Weber, Blake Koford, Patrick Barfield, Maya Martinez, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg, Thomas Gredig, Claudia Ojeda-Aristizabal</p>
            <p>Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a molecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be quantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene. Here, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine / bilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression of trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the manifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization properties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of 3.6$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very small degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the deposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the CuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission electron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20989v1" target="_blank">Photonic Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks with Adaptive State   Injection</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Monbroussou, Beatrice Polacchi, Verena Yacoub, Eugenio Caruccio, Giovanni Rodari, Francesco Hoch, Gonzalo Carvacho, Nicolò Spagnolo, Taira Giordani, Mattia Bossi, Abhiram Rajan, Niki Di Giano, Riccardo Albiero, Francesco Ceccarelli, Roberto Osellame, Elham Kashefi, Fabio Sciarrino</p>
            <p>Linear optical architectures have been extensively investigated for quantum computing and quantum machine learning applications. Recently, proposals for photonic quantum machine learning have combined linear optics with resource adaptivity, such as adaptive circuit reconfiguration, which promises to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performances and scalability. Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20987v1" target="_blank">Localized Fock Space Cages in Kinetically Constrained Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheryne Jonay, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14632v2" target="_blank">Visualization of high-intensity laser-matter interactions in virtual   reality and web browser</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Matys, James P. Thistlewood, Mariana Kecová, Petr Valenta, Martina Greplová Žáková, Martin Jirka, Prokopis Hadjisolomou, Alžběta Špádová, Marcel Lamač, Sergei V. Bulanov</p>
            <p>We present the Virtual Beamline (VBL) application, an interactive web-based platform for visualizing high-intensity laser-matter interactions using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, with future potential for experimental data visualization. These interactions include ion acceleration, electron acceleration, $\gamma$-flash generation, electron-positron pair production, and attosecond and spiral pulse generation. Developed at the ELI Beamlines facility, VBL integrates a custom-built WebGL engine with WebXR-based Virtual Reality (VR) support, allowing users to explore complex plasma dynamics in non-VR mode on a computer screen or in fully immersive VR mode using a head-mounted display. The application runs directly in a standard web browser, ensuring broad accessibility. VBL enhances the visualization of PIC simulations by efficiently processing and rendering four main data types: point particles, 1D lines, 2D textures, and 3D volumes. By utilizing interactive 3D visualization, it overcomes the limitations of traditional 2D representations, offering enhanced spatial understanding and real-time manipulation of visualization parameters such as time steps, data layers, colormaps. Users can interactively explore the visualized data by moving their body or using a controller for navigation, zooming, and rotation. These interactive capabilities improve data exploration and interpretation, making VBL a valuable tool for both scientific analysis and educational outreach. The visualizations are hosted online and freely accessible on our server, providing researchers, the general public, and broader audiences with an interactive tool to explore complex plasma physics simulations. By offering an intuitive and dynamic approach to large-scale datasets, VBL enhances both scientific research and knowledge dissemination in high-intensity laser-matter physics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04566v2" target="_blank">Long-range nonstabilizerness from quantum codes, orders, and   correlations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuchuan Wei, Zi-Wen Liu</p>
            <p>Understanding nonstabilizerness (aka quantum magic) in many-body quantum systems, particularly its interplay with entanglement, represents an important quest in quantum computation and many-body physics. Drawing natural motivations from the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically investigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness that cannot be (approximately) erased by shallow local unitary circuits. In doing so, we prove a robust generalization of the Bravyi--K\"onig theorem. By establishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates on quantum error-correcting codes, we show that certain families of topological stabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of topological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes, such as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which yields a ``no lowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we discuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and learning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect correlation functions with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties. Most of our concepts and techniques do not rely on geometric locality and can be extended to systems with general connectivity. Our study leverages and sheds new light on the interplay between quantum resources, error correction and fault tolerance, complexity theory, and many-body physics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20982v1" target="_blank">Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms for k-means clustering   via uniform sampling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Chen, Archan Ray, Akshay Seshadri, Dylan Herman, Bao Bach, Pranav Deshpande, Abhishek Som, Niraj Kumar, Marco Pistoia</p>
            <p>The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20981v1" target="_blank">Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in   Silicon</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki</p>
            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>
