            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17790v1" target="_blank">Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine   Permutation Construction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenta Kasai</p>
            <p>We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded by 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding performance.   Joint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of low-weight codewords in $C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp$ and $C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition, we obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which we conjecture to be tight.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17786v1" target="_blank">Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17783v1" target="_blank">Nanoscale infrared and microwave imaging of stacking faults in   multilayer graphene</a></h3>

            <p>Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17781v1" target="_blank">Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, Nibedita Padhi, Aditya Sharma, Sourav Singha</p>
            <p>We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5 where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13902v2" target="_blank">Secure Quantum Key Distribution Using a Room-Temperature Quantum Emitter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ömer S. Tapşın, Furkan Ağlarcı, Roberto G. Pousa, Daniel K. L. Oi, Mustafa Gündoğan, Serkan Ateş</p>
            <p>On-demand generation of single photons from solid-state quantum emitters is essential to build practical quantum networks and QKD systems by potentially enabling higher secure key rates (SKR) and lower quantum bit error rates (QBER) in short-range distances. Room-temperature operation is particularly important as it eliminates the need for bulky cryogenic setups, reducing complexity and cost for real-world applications. In this work, we showcase the versatility of defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) at room temperature by implementing the B92 protocol. Our experiments yield a sifted key rate (SiKR) of 17.5 kbps with a QBER of 6.49% at a dynamic polarization encoding rate of 40 MHz, and finite-key analysis provides a SKR of 7 kbps, one of the highest achieved for a room-temperature single photon source. We analyzed the non-decoy efficient BB84 using our hBN emitter and other promising quantum dot source for QKD, and compare their key performance with a single quantum repeater scenario. We also explore potential applications of hBN defects beyond QKD and analyze scenarios that could outperform conventional point-to-point QKD schemes. These results underscore the promise of hBN emitters for advancing quantum communication technologies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12068v2" target="_blank">Time Advance and Probability Conservation in $PT$-Symmetric Quantum   Mechanics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip D. Mannheim</p>
            <p>When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that $V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17774v1" target="_blank">Collisionless ion-electron energy exchange in magnetized shocks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Zhang, P. V. Heuer, H. Wen, J. R. Davies, C. Ren, D. B. Schaeffer, E. G. Blackman, J. Zhang, A. Bret, F. García-Rubio</p>
            <p>Energy partition between ions and electrons in collisionless shocks has long been an unsolved fundamental physical problem. We show that kinetic simulations of moderate Alfv\'enic Mach number, magnetized, collisionless shocks reveal rapid, faster-than-Coulomb, energy exchange between ions and electrons when the plasma is sufficiently magnetized. Using kinetic and multi-fluid models with counter-streaming ions, we identify resonances between electron whistler and ion magnetohydrodynamic waves that account for this rapid energy exchange.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17773v1" target="_blank">Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17772v1" target="_blank">Demagnetization in micromagnetics: magnetostatic self-interactions of   bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Leask, Martin Speight</p>
            <p>It is known that the magnetization in a ferromagnet induces an internal demagnetizing magnetic field. This, in-turn, generates a magnetostatic self-energy, coming from dipole-dipole interactions. In general, this energy is singular and intrinsically non-local. However, one can introduce a magnetic scalar potential associated with the demagnetizing field. We show that computation of the magnetic potential can be achieved by solving Poisson's equation where the source is the divergence of the magnetization. Furthermore, we determine the variation of the magnetostatic self-energy and its associated back-reaction on the magnetization. Then, we present a theoretical study of the effect of the long-range dipolar interaction on magnetic skyrmion textures in the bulk of chiral ferromagnetic materials with the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. It is observed that the demagnetizing dipolar self-interaction can stabilize antiskyrmion crystals in Heusler compounds.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17771v1" target="_blank">Integrating Learning-Based Manipulation and Physics-Based Locomotion for   Whole-Body Badminton Robot Control</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haochen Wang, Zhiwei Shi, Chengxi Zhu, Yafei Qiao, Cheng Zhang, Fan Yang, Pengjie Ren, Lan Lu, Dong Xuan</p>
            <p>Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.</p>
