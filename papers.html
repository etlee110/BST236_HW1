            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24386v1" target="_blank">How interacting Bose gases scatter light</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Konstantinou, Yansheng Zhang, Paul H. C. Wong, Feiyang Wang, Yu-Kun Lu, Nishant Dogra, Christoph Eigen, Tanish Satoor, Wolfgang Ketterle, Zoran Hadzibabic</p>
            <p>The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24384v1" target="_blank">High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew G. Sullivan, Roger W. Romani</p>
            <p>The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS typically wraps around the sub-stellar companion, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a marginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in J2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to estimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\rm IBS} \sim 40-100$ G and place lower bounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the magnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24383v1" target="_blank">Two-color magneto-optical trapping of ytterbium atoms</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Li, Yufei Wang, Ligeng Yu, Bo Song</p>
            <p>We report laser cooling and trapping of ytterbium atoms in a two-color magneto-optical trap (MOT). Benefited from both the broad singlet transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^1\text{P}_1$) and the narrow intercombination transition ($^1\text{S}_0\rightarrow {}^3\text{P}_1$) of ytterbium atoms, the two-color MOT enables rapid loading and efficient cooling. We systematically investigate the shielding effect of the intercombination transition by examining the atom loading and loss rates of single-color and two-color MOTs. Our findings are general and can be extended to other alkaline earth(-like) atoms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18917v3" target="_blank">Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy   Counts</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chin Yi Tan, Ariane Dekker, Alex Drlica-Wagner</p>
            <p>Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24380v1" target="_blank">The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified   framework and exact results</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24375v2" target="_blank">Transverse orbital angular momentum: setting the record straight</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. Tripathi, S. W. Hancock, H. M. Milchberg</p>
            <p>The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24372v1" target="_blank">A criterion on the free energy for log-Sobolev inequalities in   mean-field particle systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Bauerschmidt, T. Bodineau, B. Dagallier</p>
            <p>For a class of mean-field particle systems, we formulate a criterion in terms of the free energy that implies uniform bounds on the log-Sobolev constant of the associated Langevin dynamics. For certain double-well potentials with quadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of the model, and we also obtain precise asymptotics on the decay of the log-Sobolev constant when approaching the critical point. The criterion also applies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense, possibly random graphs. We further generalize the criterion to non-quadratic interactions that admit a mode decomposition. The mode decomposition is different from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for short-range spin systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24369v1" target="_blank">Exploring light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics: phase and   group velocities and related phenomena</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. W. Cruz, V. A. De Lorenci, E. Guzmán-Herrera, C. C. H. Ribeiro</p>
            <p>Nonlinear electrodynamics has been an important area of research for a long time. Investigations based on nonlinear Lagrangians, such as Euler-Heisenberg and Born-Infeld, are instrumental in exploring the limits of classical and quantum field theories, providing valuable insights into strong-field phenomena. In this context, this work considers how light propagates in strong-field environments, where such nonlinearities play significant roles, offering a way to investigate events in high-energy astrophysics, quantum optics, and fundamental physics beyond classical Maxwell's framework. Here, several aspects of light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics are discussed. Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting behaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and asymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations. Specific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also investigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are discussed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24367v1" target="_blank">The structure and topology of an amorphous metal-organic framework</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas C. Nicholas, Daniel F. Thomas du Toit, Louise A. M. Rosset, Davide M. Proserpio, Andrew L. Goodwin, Volker L. Deringer</p>
            <p>Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more generally.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24362v1" target="_blank">Quench dynamics via recursion method and dynamical quantum phase   transitions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Shirokov, Viacheslav Hrushev, Filipp Uskov, Ivan Dudinets, Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy</p>
            <p>The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</p>
