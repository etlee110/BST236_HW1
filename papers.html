            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01424v1" target="_blank">Computational, Data-Driven, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning   Approaches for Microstructure Modeling in Metal Additive Manufacturing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Patel, R. Sharma, Y. B. Guo</p>
            <p>Metal additive manufacturing enables unprecedented design freedom and the production of customized, complex components. However, the rapid melting and solidification dynamics inherent to metal AM processes generate heterogeneous, non-equilibrium microstructures that significantly impact mechanical properties and subsequent functionality. Predicting microstructure and its evolution across spatial and temporal scales remains a central challenge for process optimization and defect mitigation. While conventional experimental techniques and physics-based simulations provide a physical foundation and valuable insights, they face critical limitations. In contrast, data-driven machine learning offers an alternative prediction approach and powerful pattern recognition but often operate as black-box, lacking generalizability and physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, physics-informed machine learning, including physics-informed neural networks, has emerged as a promising paradigm by embedding governing physical laws into neural network architectures, thereby enhancing accuracy, transparency, data efficiency, and extrapolation capabilities. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of modeling strategies for microstructure prediction in metal AM. The strengths and limitations of experimental, computational, and data-driven methods are analyzed in depth, and highlight recent advances in hybrid PIML frameworks that integrate physical knowledge with ML. Key challenges, such as data scarcity, multi-scale coupling, and uncertainty quantification, are discussed alongside future directions. Ultimately, this assessment underscores the importance of PIML-based hybrid approaches in enabling predictive, scalable, and physically consistent microstructure modeling for site-specific, microstructure-aware process control and the reliable production of high-performance AM components.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01422v1" target="_blank">Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo P. de Brito, Astrid Eichhorn, Antonio D. Pereira, Masatoshi Yamada</p>
            <p>There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Thus, we first investigate whether the Weinberg operator, a dimension-five-operator that generates neutrino masses without requiring degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model, can arise in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We find a negative answer with far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the Standard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of the visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\, \rm GeV$ for this bound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\, \rm GeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural" value of the Seesaw scale in a quantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound for the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\, \rm GeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01418v1" target="_blank">Weyl symmetry in $(D_4,D_4)$ conformal matter on a circle</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Yue Wei</p>
            <p>We study Weyl symmetry in quadrivalently glued 5-brane webs of rank $N$ $(D_4,D_4)$ conformal matter theories on a circle. We find that these theories all have affine $E_8$ Weyl symmetry in their brane webs, which indicates that they all have affine $E_8$ global symmetry. When $N\geq 2$, the theory has 64 different sets of affine $E_8$ invariant Coulomb branch parameters.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06331v3" target="_blank">Two-dimensional delta-Bose gas: skew-product relative motions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ting Chen</p>
            <p>We prove a Feynman-Kac-type formula for the relative motion of the two-body delta-Bose gas in two dimensions. The multiplicative functional is not exponential, and the process is a skew-product diffusion uniquely extended in law, in the sense of Erickson [30], from ${\rm BES}(0,\beta{\downarrow})$ of Donati-Martin and Yor [27] as the radial part. We give two different proofs of the formula. The first uses the original excursion characterization of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$, and the second is via the lower-dimensional Bessel processes at the expectation level. The latter proof contrasts the long-standing approach for delta-function interactions by adding mollifiers to the Laplacians since the present approximations are from "lower, fractional dimensions." Moreover, the second proof conducts a new study of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ as an SDE since we handle the drift via certain ratios of the Macdonald functions. The properties proven include the strong well-posedness and comparison of the SDE of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ for all initial conditions. In particular, this well-posedness contrasts the fact that the skew-product diffusion for the Feynman-Kac-type formula has a singular drift of $L^p_{\rm\tiny loc}$-integrability only for $ p\leq 2$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01415v1" target="_blank">How Effective are Large Time Series Models in Hydrology? A Study on   Water Level Forecasting in Everglades</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahuul Rangaraj, Jimeng Shi, Azam Shirali, Rajendra Paudel, Yanzhao Wu, Giri Narasimhan</p>
            <p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01414v1" target="_blank">Predicting Plasma Temperature From Line Intensities Using ML Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashwini Malviya</p>
            <p>In this work, ML models were used to predict the plasma temperature using the dataset obtained by implementing the CR-model for Na-like Krypton. The models included in the study are: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network. For evaluating the models we used Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score as metrics, In our study Random Forest performed best as compared to other model considered, the study conclude that complex relation between the line-intensities and Plasma temperature can be capture by ML models and they can be used to predict the temperature with high accuracy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01412v1" target="_blank">Collection of fluorescence from an ion using trap-integrated photonics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix W. Knollmann, Sabrina M. Corsetti, Ethan R. Clements, Reuel Swint, Aaron D. Leu, May E. Kim, Patrick T. Callahan, Dave Kharas, Thomas Mahony, Cheryl Sorace-Agaskar, Robert McConnell, Colin D. Bruzewicz, Isaac L. Chuang, Jelena Notaros, John Chiaverini</p>
            <p>Spontaneously emitted photons are entangled with the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom of the emitting atom, so interference and measurement of these photons can entangle separate matter-based quantum systems as a resource for quantum information processing. However, the isotropic nature of spontaneous emission hinders the single-mode photonic operations required to generate entanglement. Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state. This proof-of-principle demonstration lays the foundation for leveraging the inherent stability and reproducibility of integrated photonics to efficiently create, manipulate, and measure multipartite quantum states in arrays of quantum emitters.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17662v2" target="_blank">RoboPEPP: Vision-Based Robot Pose and Joint Angle Estimation through   Embedding Predictive Pre-Training</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raktim Gautam Goswami, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Yann LeCun, Farshad Khorrami</p>
            <p>Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles has applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks. Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01407v1" target="_blank">Dirac Scoto Inverse-Seesaw from $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranjeet Kumar, Newton Nath, Rahul Srivastava, Sushant Yadav</p>
            <p>We present a Dirac scotogenic-like one loop radiative model where the stability of dark matter is intricately linked to the breaking of $A_4$ flavor symmetry. This breaking induces a $Z_2$ dark symmetry, stabilizing the dark matter candidate. The breaking of $A_4 \to Z_2$ leads to cutting the loop and facilitating a "scoto inverse-seesaw" mass mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation. This elucidates the explicit explanation of two mass-squared differences, $\Delta m^2_{\rm{atm}}$ and $\Delta m^2_{\rm{sol}}$ observed in neutrino oscillations. Our model accounts for normal and inverted ordering of neutrino masses, revealing sharp correlations between $\sum m_i$ and $\langle m_{\beta} \rangle$. It also shows strong compatibility with current data in the $\delta_{CP}$-$\theta_{23}$ plane. Moreover, stringent constraints on scalar masses narrow down the viable dark matter mass regions, accommodating $SU(2)_L$ singlet and doublet scalar dark matter as well as fermionic dark matter. Additionally, our model presents a viable avenue for addressing lepton flavor violating decays while remaining consistent with current experimental constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kalman Szenes, Nina Glaser, Mihael Erakovic, Valentin Barandun, Maximilian Mörchen, Robin Feldmann, Stefano Battaglia, Alberto Baiardi, Markus Reiher</p>
            <p>QCMaquis is a quantum chemistry software package for general molecular structure calculations in a matrix product state/matrix product operator formalism of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries. This paper reviews all the new features of QCMaquis and demonstrates them with new results.</p>
