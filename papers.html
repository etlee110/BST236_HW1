            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08735v1" target="_blank">Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin   textures</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Akram, Onur Erten</p>
            <p>Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08732v1" target="_blank">Quantum Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hyub Kim, Jonathan Mei, Claudio Girotto, Masako Yamada, Martin Roetteler</p>
            <p>We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning architecture for large language model fine-tuning. The classical portion of the architecture is a sentence transformer that is powerful enough to display significant accuracy for complex tasks such as sentiment prediction. The quantum portion of the architecture consists of parameterized quantum circuits that utilize long-range connections between qubits.   We analyze the performance of the hybrid models for various settings of hyperparameters, including the number of qubits, the depth of the quantum circuits, learning rate, number of re-uploading steps, etc. Based on a screening study of main effects, we show an overall improvement in prediction accuracy over a comparable classical baseline, with a trend of increasing accuracy with number of qubits. We observe up to $3.14\%$ improvements in accuracy over classical architectures of comparable model size, within the set of hyperparameters probed in this study.   We demonstrate the contribution of each module in our architecture through ablation studies. Our studies are based on finite shot-counts and include simulations based on noisy quantum gates.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07948v2" target="_blank">Pushing the Accuracy Limit of Foundation Neural Network Models with   Quantum Monte Carlo Forces and Path Integrals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anouar Benali, Thomas Plé, Olivier Adjoua, Valay Agarawal, Thomas Applencourt, Marharyta Blazhynska, Raymond Clay III, Kevin Gasperich, Khalid Hossain, Jeongnim Kim, Christopher Knight, Jaron T.

            <p>We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy to produce highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets (energies and forces) aimed at deriving Foundation Machine Learning models for molecular simulation. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT), a "Jacob's Ladder" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively parallel GPU-accelerated software with increasing accuracy. Thanks to Exascale, this is the first time that the computationally intensive calculation of Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) forces, and the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces with selected-CI wavefunctions, are computed at such scale at the complete basis-set-limit. To bridge the gap between accurate QC and condensed-phase molecular dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve the FeNNix-Bio1 DFT-based foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled to path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond reactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy. These results demonstrate the promise of Exascale to deepen our understanding of the inner machinery of complex biosystems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08728v1" target="_blank">End-to-End Demonstration of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for   Steel Microstructure Image Augmentation on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samwel Sekwao, Jason Iaconis, Claudio Girotto, Martin Roetteler, Minwoo Kang, Donghwi Kim, Seunghyo Noh, Woomin Kyoung, Kyujin Shin</p>
            <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a machine learning technique capable of producing high-quality synthetic images. In the field of materials science, when a crystallographic dataset includes inadequate or difficult-to-obtain images, synthetic images can be used for image augmentation to mitigate data scarcity and streamline the preparation of datasets for high-throughput analysis. We integrate quantum computing with GANs into a hybrid quantum-classical GAN to generate complex 5-channel electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images of two distinct microstructure phases of steel. By training a quantum circuit at the input layer of a large classical Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) model, we mitigate mode collapse and achieve higher image quality compared to a baseline classical GAN. We generate images from both ferrite and bainite microstructure phases in an end-to-end workflow. With respect to maximum mean discrepancy score, we find that the hybrid quantum-classical WGAN improves over classical Bernoulli GANs in 70% of samples. As the quantum computer is part of the training procedure, our method has potential to scale to larger number of qubits. Our results indicate that the WGAN model based on the quantum circuit ansatz may be effectively leveraged to enhance the quality of synthetic EBSD images on both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05309v2" target="_blank">Piecewise linear constitutive relations for stretch-limited elastic   strings</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roger Bustamante, K. R. Rajagopal, Casey Rodriguez</p>
            <p>This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17028v2" target="_blank">Longitudinal tapering in meter-scale gas jets for increased efficiency   of laser plasma accelerators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Li, A. Picksley, C. Benedetti, F. Filippi, J. Stackhouse, L. Fan-Chiang, H. E. Tsai, K. Nakamura, C. B. Schroeder, J. van Tilborg, E. Esarey, C. G. R. Geddes, A. J. Gonsalves</p>
            <p>Modern laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) often require plasma waveguides tens of cm long to propagate a high-intensity drive laser pulse. Tapering the longitudinal gas density profile in 10 cm scale gas jets could allow for single stage laser plasma acceleration well beyond 10 GeV with current petawatt-class laser systems. Via simulation and interferometry measurements, we show density control by longitudinally adjusting the throat width and jet angle. Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from ~9 GeV to >12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09151v3" target="_blank">Higher spin swampland conjecture for massive AdS$_{3}$ gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Sammani, E. H Saidi</p>
            <p>In this paper, we show that a possible version of the swampland weak gravity conjecture for higher spin (HS) massive topological AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be expressed in terms of mass $M_{hs}$, charge $Q_{hs}$ and coupling constant $g_{hs}$ of 3D gravity coupled to higher spin fields as $M_{hs} \leq \sqrt{2}$ $Q_{hs}$ $g_{hs}$ $M_{Pl}$. The higher spin charge is given by the $SO(1,2)$ quadratic Casimir $Q_{hs}^{2}=s\left (s-1\right) $ and the HS coupling constant by ${\large g}_{hs} ^{2}=2/\left (M_{Pl}^{2} l_{AdS_{3}}^{2}\right )$ while the mass expressed like $\left( l_{AdS_{3}} \text{M}_{hs}\right) ^{2}$ is defined as $ \left (1+\mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} s \left ( s-1 \right ) +[1- \left ( \mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} \left ( s-1 \right ) ]$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08724v1" target="_blank">Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an   ensemble of code CFTs</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anatoly Dymarsky, Johan Henriksson, Brian McPeak</p>
            <p>We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08723v1" target="_blank">Deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's Instantons on Bryant-Salamon   $Spin(7)$-Manifold</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tathagata Ghosh</p>
            <p>In this paper we compute the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons on the Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold. The Bryant-Salamon $Spin(7)$-Manifold -- the negative spinor bundle of $S^4$ -- is an asymptotically conical manifold where the link is the squashed $7$-sphere. We use the deformation theory developed by the author in a previous paper to calculate the deformations of Clarke-Oliveira's instantons and calculate the virtual dimensions of the moduli spaces.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08721v1" target="_blank">Surrogate-based optimization of system architectures subject to hidden   constraints</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasper Bussemaker, Paul Saves, Nathalie Bartoli, Thierry Lefebvre, Björn Nagel</p>
            <p>The exploration of novel architectures requires physics-based simulation due to a lack of prior experience to start from, which introduces two specific challenges for optimization algorithms: evaluations become more expensive (in time) and evaluations might fail. The former challenge is addressed by Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms, in particular Bayesian Optimization (BO) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. An overview is provided of how BO can deal with challenges specific to architecture optimization, such as design variable hierarchy and multiple objectives: specific measures include ensemble infills and a hierarchical sampling algorithm. Evaluations might fail due to non-convergence of underlying solvers or infeasible geometry in certain areas of the design space. Such failed evaluations, also known as hidden constraints, pose a particular challenge to SBO/BO, as the surrogate model cannot be trained on empty results. This work investigates various strategies for satisfying hidden constraints in BO algorithms. Three high-level strategies are identified: rejection of failed points from the training set, replacing failed points based on viable (non-failed) points, and predicting the failure region. Through investigations on a set of test problems including a jet engine architecture optimization problem, it is shown that best performance is achieved with a mixed-discrete GP to predict the Probability of Viability (PoV), and by ensuring selected infill points satisfy some minimum PoV threshold. This strategy is demonstrated by solving a jet engine architecture problem that features at 50% failure rate and could not previously be solved by a BO algorithm. The developed BO algorithm and used test problems are available in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt.</p>
