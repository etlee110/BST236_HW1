            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00704v1" target="_blank">Controllable Weather Synthesis and Removal with Video Diffusion Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Hao Lin, Zian Wang, Ruofan Liang, Yuxuan Zhang, Sanja Fidler, Shenlong Wang, Zan Gojcic</p>
            <p>Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00701v1" target="_blank">A log-depth in-place quantum Fourier transform that rarely needs   ancillas</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory D. Kahanamoku-Meyer, John Blue, Thiago Bergamaschi, Craig Gidney, Isaac L. Chuang</p>
            <p>When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper to achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such "optimistic quantum circuits" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\log (n / \epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is logarithmically local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\log n)$ total qubits. Applying our reduction technique, we also construct the first approximate QFT to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\log (n/\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits, well-controlled error on all inputs, and no intermediate measurements.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00698v1" target="_blank">Comprehensive Study on Heisenberg-limited Quantum Algorithms for   Multiple Observables Estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>In the accompanying paper of arXiv:25XX.XXXXX, we have presented a generalized scheme of adaptive quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm, and further proposed two practical variants which not only achieve doubly quantum enhancement in query complexity regarding estimation precision and number of observables, but also enable minimal cost to estimate $k$-RDMs in fermionic systems among existing quantum algorithms. Here, we provide full descriptions on the algorithm, and provide theoretical guarantee for the estimation precision in terms of the root mean squared error. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of the Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is minimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation algorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the query complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based methods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic $k$-RDMs.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00697v1" target="_blank">Faster Quantum Algorithm for Multiple Observables Estimation in   Fermionic Problems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Koizumi, Kaito Wada, Wataru Mizukami, Nobuyuki Yoshioka</p>
            <p>Achieving quantum advantage in efficiently estimating collective properties of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental goal in quantum computing. While the quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm has been shown to achieve doubly quantum enhancement in the precision and the number of observables, it remains unclear whether one benefits in practical applications. In this work, we present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further propose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of fermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms. The first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the second method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel scheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with prior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems with limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical demonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals improve the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a factor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for Fermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00695v1" target="_blank">Simple Holography in General Spacetimes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Bousso, Elisa Tabor</p>
            <p>The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case.   The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00694v1" target="_blank">What is the Hierarchy Problem?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael E. Peskin</p>
            <p>Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00691v1" target="_blank">Physical Limits and Optimal Synthesis of Beyond Diagonal Anomalous   Scatterers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mats Gustafsson</p>
            <p>Realizing metasurfaces for anomalous scattering is fundamental to designing reflector arrays, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and metasurface antennas. However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular directions is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on anomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local matching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on the solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds. Furthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented with metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite design region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar cross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction. Numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of achieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for canonical configurations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18506v2" target="_blank">Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path   Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Raja, Martin Šípka, Michael Psenka, Tobias Kreiman, Michal Pavelka, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11274v3" target="_blank">Perturbing the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating   acoustic geometries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. S. Vieira, Kyriakos Destounis, Kostas D. Kokkotas</p>
            <p>Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00689v1" target="_blank">Axially symmetric collapses in the 2-D Benjamin-Ono equation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph O. Oloo, Victor I. Shrira</p>
            <p>We study the nonlinear dynamics of localized perturbations within the framework of the essentially two-dimensional generalization of the Benjamin-Ono equation (2D-BO) derived asymptotically from the Navier-Stokes equation. By simulating the 2D-BO equation with the pseudospectral method, we confirm that the localized initial perturbations exceeding a certain threshold collapse, forming a point singularity. Although the 2D-BO equation does not possess axial symmetry, we show that in the vicinity of the collapse singularity, the solution becomes axially-symmetric, whatever its initial shape. We find that perturbations collapse in a self-similar manner, with the perturbation amplitude exploding as $ (\check \tau)^{-\lambda}$ and its transverse scale shrinking as $ (\check \tau)^{\lambda}$, where $\check \tau$ is the time to the moment of singularity. We derive a family of self-similar solutions describing axially symmetric collapses. The value of the free parameter $ {\lambda}$ in the self-similar solution is specified by fitting it to the numerical simulation of the initial problem of the evolution of an initially localized perturbation. Remarkably, for the examples we examined the value of the parameter proved to be almost universal: $ {\lambda} \approx 0.9$; its dependence on the initial conditions is indiscernible. In the vicinity of the singularity, the dynamics becomes one-dimensional, thus, the derived reduction of the 2D-BO equation provides an effectively one-dimensional model of collapse.</p>
