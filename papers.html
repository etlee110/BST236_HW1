            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16550v2" target="_blank">PhysAnimator: Physics-Guided Generative Cartoon Animation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Xie, Yiwei Zhao, Ying Jiang, Chenfanfu Jiang</p>
            <p>Creating hand-drawn animation sequences is labor-intensive and demands professional expertise. We introduce PhysAnimator, a novel approach for generating physically plausible meanwhile anime-stylized animation from static anime illustrations. Our method seamlessly integrates physics-based simulations with data-driven generative models to produce dynamic and visually compelling animations. To capture the fluidity and exaggeration characteristic of anime, we perform image-space deformable body simulations on extracted mesh geometries. We enhance artistic control by introducing customizable energy strokes and incorporating rigging point support, enabling the creation of tailored animation effects such as wind interactions. Finally, we extract and warp sketches from the simulation sequence, generating a texture-agnostic representation, and employ a sketch-guided video diffusion model to synthesize high-quality animation frames. The resulting animations exhibit temporal consistency and visual plausibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating dynamic anime-style animations.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20780v1" target="_blank">Inclusive hadroproduction of charmonia-bottomonia pairs in the CGC   framework</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Siddikov</p>
            <p>In this preprint we analyze the inclusive hadroproduction of heavy charmonia-bottomonia pairs in the Color Glass Condensate framework in the dilute-dense approximation. The production mechanisms can be classified by number of gluons emitted from projectile as Single- and Double Parton Scattering. We analyzed separately both types of contributions and evaluated the corresponding impact factors in the leading order in strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$. For the Double Parton Scattering the impact factors factorize into a product of impact factors of single charmonia and bottomonia production cross-sections, and the cross-section in the large-$N_{c}$ limit reduces to the well-known pocket formula. For the Single Parton Scattering we found that the cross-section of the process is sensitive to dipole, quadrupole, sextupole and octupole scattering amplitudes (correlators of Wilson lines), thus opening possibility to study phenomenologically these novel objects. We also made phenomenological estimates of the cross-sections in the dilute approximation and found that the suggested approach provides a fair qualitative description of the LHCb data for $J/\psi+\Upsilon(1S)$ production.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20779v1" target="_blank">PGC: Physics-Based Gaussian Cloth from a Single Pose</a></h3>

            <p>We introduce a novel approach to reconstruct simulation-ready garments with intricate appearance. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting. Project page: https://phys-gaussian-cloth.github.io .</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20778v1" target="_blank">Detectability of the chiral gravitational wave background from audible   axions with the LISA-Taiji network</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Su, Baoyu Xu, Ju Chen, Chang Liu, Yun-Long Zhang</p>
            <p>The chiral gravitational wave background (GWB) can be produced by axion-like fields in the early universe. We perform parameter estimation for two types of chiral GWB with the LISA-Taiji network: axion-dark photon coupling and axion-Nieh-Yan coupling. We estimate the spectral parameters of these two mechanisms induced by axion and determine the normalized model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. For highly chiral GWB signals that we choose to analyze in the mHz band, the normalized model parameters are constrained with a relative error less than $6.7\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $2.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level. The circular polarization parameters are constrained with a relative error around $21\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $6.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20770v1" target="_blank">Explaining the UV to X-ray correlation in AGN within the framework of   X-ray illumination of accretion discs</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kammoun, I. E. Papadakis, M. Dov훾iak, E. Lusso, E. Nardini, G. Risaliti</p>
            <p>It is established that the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray emissions in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are tightly correlated. This correlation is observed both in low- and high-redshift sources. In particular, observations of large samples of quasars revealed the presence of a non-linear correlation between UV and X-rays. The physical origin of this correlation is poorly understood. In this work, we explore this observed correlation in the framework of the X-ray illumination of the accretion disc by a central source. We have shown in previous works that this model successfully explains the continuum UV/optical time delays, variability, and the broadband spectral energy distribution in AGN. We use this model to produce $150,000$ model SEDs assuming a uniform distribution of model parameters. We compute the corresponding UV ($ 2500~\r{A} $) and X-ray (2 keV) monochromatic luminosities and select only the model data points that agree with the observed UV-to-X-ray correlation. Our results show that the X-ray illumination of accretion disc model can reproduce the observed correlation for a subset of model configurations with a non-uniform distribution of black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$), and power transferred from the accretion disc to the corona ($L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$). In addition, our results reveal the presence of a correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, and between $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$, to explain the observed X-ray-UV correlation. We also present evidence based on observed luminosities supporting our findings. We finally discuss the implications of our results.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07943v2" target="_blank">A Pretraining-Finetuning Computational Framework for Material   Homogenization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizheng Wang, Xiang Li, Ziming Yan, Shuaifeng Ma, Jinshuai Bai, Bokai Liu, Timon Rabczuk, Yinghua Liu</p>
            <p>Homogenization is a fundamental tool for studying multiscale physical phenomena. Traditional numerical homogenization methods, heavily reliant on finite element analysis, demand significant computational resources, especially for complex geometries, materials, and high-resolution problems. To address these challenges, we propose PreFine-Homo, a novel numerical homogenization framework comprising two phases: pretraining and fine-tuning. In the pretraining phase, a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is trained on large datasets to learn the mapping from input geometries and material properties to displacement fields. In the fine-tuning phase, the pretrained predictions serve as initial solutions for iterative algorithms, drastically reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence. The pretraining phase of PreFine-Homo delivers homogenization results up to 1000 times faster than conventional methods, while the fine-tuning phase further enhances accuracy. Moreover, the fine-tuning phase grants PreFine-Homo unlimited generalization capabilities, enabling continuous learning and improvement as data availability increases. We validate PreFine-Homo by predicting the effective elastic tensor for 3D periodic materials, specifically Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS). The results demonstrate that PreFine-Homo achieves high precision, exceptional efficiency, robust learning capabilities, and strong extrapolation ability, establishing it as a powerful tool for multiscale homogenization tasks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20765v1" target="_blank">Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the   multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Gavassino, Henry Hirvonen, Jean-Fran챌ois Paquet, Mayank Singh, Gabriel Soares Rocha</p>
            <p>The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$. We discuss the importance of the ``effective volume'' needed for the thermodynamics arguments. Our results indicate that the agreement of $b_{\rm UC}$ with $c_s^2$ rather than $P/\varepsilon$ is accidental.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20763v1" target="_blank">On the magnetic perturbation theory for Chern insulators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Horia D. Cornean, Massimo Moscolari</p>
            <p>The gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory is tailored for one-body Schr\"odinger operators perturbed by long-range magnetic fields. In this work we present a self-contained exposition of the method, by outlining its technical foundations and discussing the physical heuristics behind the proofs. We apply it in order to prove the stability of spectral gaps and to study the location of the discrete spectrum. We also analyze the (lack of) continuity with respect to the magnetic field of spectral projections corresponding to finite spectral islands, which is a particularly important situation for systems modelling Chern insulators. Finally, we show how to construct approximate projections that have an explicit dependence with respect to the magnetic field parameter.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20761v1" target="_blank">Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range   Interactions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuqing Wang, Ruochen Gao, Xiaoling Wu, Berislav Bu훾a, Klaus M첩lmer, Li You, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which inevitably relaxes the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11365v2" target="_blank">Metastable Cosmological Constant and Gravitational Bubbles:   Ultra-Late-Time Transitions in Modified Gravity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Efstratiou, Leandros Perivolaropoulos</p>
            <p>The observed cosmological constant may originate as the minimum value $U_{min}$ of a scalar field potential, where the scalar field is frozen due to a large mass. If this vacuum is metastable, it may decay to a true vacuum either at present or in the future. Assuming its decay rate $\Gamma$ is comparable to the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, we estimate the scale of true vacuum bubbles and analyze their evolution. We find that their initial formation scale is sub-millimeter and their tension causes rapid collapse if $m \gtrsim 1.7 \cdot 10^{-3}\, eV$. For smaller masses, the bubbles expand at the speed of light. We extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling, finding that the nucleation scale of gravitational constant bubbles remains consistent with the sub-millimeter regime of General Relativity. The critical mass scale remains around $10^{-3}\,eV$. A theoretical estimate at redshift $z_{obs} \sim 0.01$ suggests an observable bubble radius of $\sim 50$ Mpc, implying a gravitational transition triggered $\sim 300$ Myr ago, with a present-day size approaching $100$ Mpc. Additionally, we explore mass ranges ($m < 10^{-3}\,eV$) and non-minimal coupling $\xi$ ranges ($10^{-8}\,eV^{2-n} - 10^{-1}\,eV^{2-n}$) that lead to a variation $\Delta G/G_N$ within the $1\%-7\%$ range. We assume non-minimal coupling of the form $F(\phi)=1/\kappa - \xi \phi^n$, with $\kappa=8\pi G_N$ and $2 \leq n \leq 9$. Finally, we review various local physics or/and transition based proposed solutions to the Hubble tension, including ultra-late-time transitional models ($z \sim 0.01$), screened fifth-force mechanisms, and the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, which features a transition at $z \sim 2$. We discuss observational hints supporting these scenarios and the theoretical challenges they face.</p>
