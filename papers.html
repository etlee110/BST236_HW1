            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01950v1" target="_blank">Nucleon scattering from lattice QCD</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Colin Morningstar</p>
            <p>Recent results from lattice QCD on baryon resonances and meson-baryon, baryon-baryon scattering are presented. Such scattering processes and resonances can be determined in lattice QCD by first obtaining the finite-volume energy spectrum of stationary states involving meson-baryon and baryon-baryon systems. A well-known quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those which produce a finite-volume spectrum which best matches that obtained from lattice QCD. The $\Delta$ resonance, a recent study of the two-pole nature of scattering near the $\Lambda(1405)$, and $NN$ scattering in the $SU(3)$ flavor limit are highlighted.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09305v2" target="_blank">Accurate and Honest Approximation of Correlated Qubit Noise</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Setiawan, Alexander V. Gramolin, Elisha S. Matekole, Hari Krovi, Jacob M. Taylor</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. We propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also ``honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,2]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic characterization of multi-qubit noise correlations, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximations to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01942v1" target="_blank">De Sitter entropy: on-shell versus off-shell</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitrii Diakonov</p>
            <p>Attributing thermodynamic properties to the Bunch-Davies state in static patch of de Sitter space and setting the corresponding equations of state, we demonstrate that, for pure gravity, the bulk entropy computed on-shell as a volume integral in de Sitter space coincides with the Wald entropy (area law) in any spacetime dimension and for any theory of f(R) gravity. We extend this result to the renormalized entanglement entropy of a non-minimally coupled scalar field. From the on-shell perspective, entropy emerges as a bulk contribution, whereas from the off-shell viewpoint, it manifests as a boundary (horizon) contribution. As a result, in de Sitter space, generalized entropy can be understood in two distinct ways: either as a bulk or as a boundary contribution.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01937v1" target="_blank">Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rayne Liu, Wayne Hu, Huangyu Xiao</p>
            <p>Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01936v1" target="_blank">Fermionic Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Chapman, Steven T. Flammia</p>
            <p>Fermionic averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (FACES) is a protocol to simultaneously learn the averaged error rates of many fermionic linear optical (FLO) gates simultaneously and self-consistently from a suitable collection of FLO circuits. It is highly flexible, allowing for the in situ characterization of FLO-averaged gate-dependent noise under natural assumptions on a family of continuously parameterized one- and two-qubit gates. We rigorously show that our protocol has an efficient sampling complexity, owing in-part to useful properties of the Kravchuk transformations that feature in our analysis. We support our conclusions with numerical results. As FLO circuits become universal with access to certain resource states, we expect our results to inform noise characterization and error mitigation techniques on universal quantum computing architectures which naturally admit a fermionic description.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10359v2" target="_blank">Momentum-space modulated symmetries in the Luttinger liquid</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Chaduteau, Nyan Raess, Henry Davenport, Frank Schindler</p>
            <p>The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials with corresponding modulated symmetries. These symmetries are highly unconventional: they are modulated in momentum space (and do not seem to have an easy physical interpretation). We develop a systematic understanding of these symmetries and study the resulting blocks in the Hamiltonian. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic Hamiltonian block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum. These blocks are reminiscent of Hilbert space fragmentation in that, even though they are labeled by a symmetry, this symmetry is highly nonlocal and does not have a simple interpretation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01923v1" target="_blank">Sliding Dynamics of Skyrmion Molecular Crystals</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. C. Bellizotti Souza, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, N. P. Vizarim, P. A. Venegas</p>
            <p>Using both atomistic and particle-based simulations, we investigate the current-driven dynamics of skyrmions on two-dimensional periodic substrates when there are multiple skyrmions per substrate minimum. At zero drive, the system forms pinned skyrmion molecular crystal states consisting of dimers, trimers, or dimer-trimer mixtures that have both positional and orientational order. On a square substrate lattice, the motion above depinning occurs via a running soliton that travels completely transverse to the applied current. This motion is generated by a torque from the Magnus force, which rotates the $n$-mer states perpendicular to the applied current. At higher drives, the flow becomes disordered while the Hall angle diminishes and gradually approaches the intrinsic value. In some cases, we also find directional locking where the Hall angle becomes locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate over a range of currents. The transitions into and out of directionally locked states are accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the net velocity decreases as the drive increases. On a triangular substrate, we find no transverse mobility effects, but still observe directionally locked motion.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01920v1" target="_blank">Integrated sub-terahertz cavity electro-optic transduction</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin K. S. Multani, Jason F. Herrmann, Emilio A. Nanni, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini</p>
            <p>Emerging communications and computing technologies will rely ever-more on expanding the useful radio frequency (RF) spectrum into the sub-THz and THz frequency range. Both classical and quantum applications would benefit from advancing integration and incorporation of sub-THz and electro-optic technologies into common devices, such as modulators. Here we demonstrate an integrated triply-resonant, superconducting electro-optic transducer. Our design incorporates an on-chip $107$ GHz sub-THz niobium titanium nitride superconducting resonator, modulating a thin-film lithium niobate optical racetrack resonator operating at telecom wavelengths. We observe a maximum photon transduction efficiency of $\eta_{\text{OE}}\approx 0.82\times 10^{-6}$ and an average single-photon electro-optic interaction rate of $g_0/2\pi\approx 0.7$ kHz. We also present a study and analysis of the challenges associated with the design of integrated sub-THz resonators and propose possible solutions to these challenges. Our work paves the way for further advancements in resonant electro-optic technologies operating at sub-THz frequencies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14474v3" target="_blank">Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno</p>
            <p>Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12167v2" target="_blank">Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population   Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Felski, Flore K. Kunst</p>
            <p>Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</p>
