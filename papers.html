            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03638v1" target="_blank">Noise constraints on sensitivity scaling in super-Heisenberg quantum   metrology</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Lordi, John Drew Wilson, Murray J. Holland, Joshua Combes</p>
            <p>Quantum-enhanced metrology surpasses classical metrology by improving estimation precision scaling with a resource $N$ (e.g., particle number or energy) from $1/\sqrt{N}$ to $1/N$. Through the use of nonlinear effects, Roy and Braunstein~\cite{Roy2008} derived a $1/2^N$ scaling. However, later works argued this exponential improvement is unphysical and that even modest gains, like $1/N^2$, may vanish under noise. We show that, in the presence of small errors, the nonlinear interactions enabling metrological enhancement induce emergent errors. The errors propagate through the sensing protocol and are magnified proportional to any intended non-linear enhancement. We identify a critical value of the parameter to be estimated, for a fixed error, below which the emergent errors can be avoided.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03636v1" target="_blank">The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Notari, Fabrizio Rompineve, Francisco Torrenti</p>
            <p>Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f<f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03634v1" target="_blank">Maximal Entropy Formalism and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinit Singh, Rishabh Gupta, Manas Sajjan, Francoise Remacle, Raphael D. Levine, Sabre Kais</p>
            <p>The connection between the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) formalism and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is natural, as both give rise to a Boltzmann-like distribution with constraints enforced by Lagrange multipliers, which corresponds to RBM parameters. We integrate RBMs into quantum state tomography (QST) by using them as probabilistic models to approximate quantum states while satisfying MaxEnt constraints. Additionally, we employ polynomially efficient quantum sampling techniques to enhance RBM training, enabling scalable and high-fidelity quantum state reconstruction. This approach provides a computationally efficient framework for applying RBMs to MaxEnt-based quantum tomography. Furthermore, our method applies to the general and previously unaddressed case of reconstructing arbitrary mixed quantum states from incomplete and potentially non-commuting sets of expectations of observables while still ensuring maximal entropy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03629v1" target="_blank">SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cody Simons, Aritra Samanta, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Konstantinos Karydis</p>
            <p>The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05739v2" target="_blank">A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of   Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amy R. Smith, Muhammad Zulqurnain, Angus G. M. Mathieson, Marek Szablewski, Michael R. C. Hunt</p>
            <p>Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03626v1" target="_blank">Quantum Speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods with Application   to Optimization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guneykan Ozgul, Xiantao Li, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Chunhao Wang</p>
            <p>We propose quantum algorithms that provide provable speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods commonly used for sampling from probability distributions of the form $\pi \propto e^{-f}$, where $f$ is a potential function. Our first approach considers Gibbs sampling for finite-sum potentials in the stochastic setting, employing an oracle that provides gradients of individual functions. In the second setting, we consider access only to a stochastic evaluation oracle, allowing simultaneous queries at two points of the potential function under the same stochastic parameter. By introducing novel techniques for stochastic gradient estimation, our algorithms improve the gradient and evaluation complexities of classical samplers, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) in terms of dimension, precision, and other problem-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we achieve quantum speedups in optimization, particularly for minimizing non-smooth and approximately convex functions that commonly appear in empirical risk minimization problems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03620v1" target="_blank">Quantum Search with In-Place Queries</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blake Holman, Ronak Ramachandran, Justin Yirka</p>
            <p>Quantum query complexity is typically characterized in terms of XOR queries |x,y> to |x,y+f(x)> or phase queries, which ensure that even queries to non-invertible functions are unitary. When querying a permutation, another natural model is unitary: in-place queries |x> to |f(x)>.   Some problems are known to require exponentially fewer in-place queries than XOR queries, but no separation has been shown in the opposite direction. A candidate for such a separation was the problem of inverting a permutation over N elements. This task, equivalent to unstructured search in the context of permutations, is solvable with $O(\sqrt{N})$ XOR queries but was conjectured to require $\Omega(N)$ in-place queries.   We refute this conjecture by designing a quantum algorithm for Permutation Inversion using $O(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Our algorithm achieves the same speedup as Grover's algorithm despite the inability to efficiently uncompute queries or perform straightforward oracle-controlled reflections.   Nonetheless, we show that there are indeed problems which require fewer XOR queries than in-place queries. We introduce a subspace-conversion problem called Function Erasure that requires 1 XOR query and $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Then, we build on a recent extension of the quantum adversary method to characterize exact conditions for a decision problem to exhibit such a separation, and we propose a candidate problem.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03617v1" target="_blank">Quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its   effects on the surface superconductivity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guodong Jiang, Tero Heikkilä, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum geometry of rhombohedral graphite/graphene (RG) surface electronic states and its effects on superconductivity. We find that the RG surface bands have a non-vanishing quantum metric at the center of the drumhead region, and the local inequality between quantum metric and Berry curvature is an equality. Therefore, their quantum geometry is analogous to the lowest Landau level (LLL). The superconducting order parameters on the two surface orbitals of RG can be polarized by the surface potential, which boosts the superconducting transition in trilayer RG triggered by the displacement field. Analyzing the superfluid properties of multilayer RG, we make a connection with the topological heavy fermion model suggested to describe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). It shows that RG fits in an unusual heavy-fermion picture with the flattest part of the surface bands carrying a nonzero supercurrent. These results may constrain the models constructed for the correlated phases of RG.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05439v2" target="_blank">Stabilizing an individual charge fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyang Ye, Ammar Ellaboudy, John M. Nichol</p>
            <p>Charge noise is a major obstacle to improved gate fidelities in silicon spin qubits. Numerous methods exist to mitigate charge noise, including improving device fabrication, dynamical decoupling, and real-time parameter estimation. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of techniques to mitigate charge noise in semiconductor quantum dots by controlling the noise sources themselves. Using two different classical feedback methods, we stabilize an individual charged two-level fluctuator in a Si/SiGe quantum dot by exploiting sensitive gate-voltage dependence of the switching times. These control methods reduce the low-frequency component of the noise power spectrum by an order of magnitude. These techniques also enable stabilizing the fluctuator in either of its states. In the future, such techniques may enable improved coherence times in quantum-dot spin qubits.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03614v1" target="_blank">Higgsing Transitions from Topological Field Theory & Non-Invertible   Symmetry in Chern-Simons Matter Theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clay Cordova, Diego García-Sepúlveda, Kantaro Ohmori</p>
            <p>Non-invertible one-form symmetries are naturally realized in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. In this work, we consider the potential realization of such symmetries in (2+1)d conformal field theories, investigating whether gapless systems can exhibit similar symmetry structures. To that end, we discuss transitions between topological field theories in (2+1)d which are driven by the Higgs mechanism in Chern-Simons matter theories. Such transitions can be modeled mesoscopically by filling spacetime with a lattice-shaped domain wall network separating the two topological phases. Along the domain walls are coset conformal field theories describing gapless chiral modes trapped by a locally vanishing scalar mass. In this presentation, the one-form symmetries of the transition point can be deduced by using anyon condensation to track lines through the domain wall network. Using this framework, we discuss a variety of concrete examples of non-invertible one-form symmetry in fixed-point theories. For instance, $SU(k)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a scalar in the symmetric tensor representation produces a transition from an $SU(k)_{2}$ phase to an $SO(k)_{4}$ phase and has non-invertible one-form symmetry $PSU(2)_{-k}$ at the fixed point. We also discuss theories with $Spin(2N)$ and $E_{7}$ gauge groups manifesting other patterns of non-invertible one-form symmetry. In many of our examples, the non-invertible one-form symmetry is not a modular invariant TQFT on its own and thus is an intrinsic part of the fixed-point dynamics.</p>
