            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04627v1" target="_blank">Is the end of Insight in Sight ?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Michel Tucny, Mihir Durve, Sauro Succi</p>
            <p>It is shown that the weight matrices of a Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based deep learning application to a rarefied gas dynamics problem described by the Boltzmann equation bear no evident link to the mathematical structure of the physical problem. Instead, the weights appear close to Gaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04625v1" target="_blank">First Observations of Solar Halo Gamma Rays Over a Full Solar Cycle</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Linden, Jung-Tsung Li, Bei Zhou, Isabelle John, Milena Crnogorčević, Annika H. G. Peter, John F. Beacom</p>
            <p>We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04626v1" target="_blank">Testing Thermal-Relic Dark Matter with a Dark Photon Mediator</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gordan Krnjaic</p>
            <p>In light of recent DAMIC-M results, we present the status of thermal-relic dark matter $\chi$ coupled to a kinetically-mixed dark photon $A^\prime$. In the predictive "direct annihilation" regime, $m_{A'} > m_\chi$, the relic abundance depends on the kinetic mixing parameter, and there is a minimum value compatible with thermal freeze out. Using only electron and nuclear recoil direct detection results, we find that for complex scalar dark matter, the direct-annihilation regime is now excluded for nearly all values of $m_\chi$; the only exception is the resonant annihilation regime where $m_{A'}\approx 2 m_\chi$. Direct annihilation relic targets for other representative models, including Majorana and Pseudo-Dirac candidates, remain viable across a wide range of model parameters, but will be tested with a combination of dedicated accelerator searches in the near future. In the opposite "secluded annihilation" regime, where $m_\chi > m_{A'}$, this scenario is excluded by cosmic microwave background measurements for all $m_\chi \lesssim 30$ GeV. Similar conclusions in both the direct and secluded regimes hold for all anomaly-free vector mediators that couple to the first generation of electrically-charged Standard Model particles.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04621v1" target="_blank">Score Distillation Sampling for Audio: Source Separation, Synthesis, and   Beyond</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessie Richter-Powell, Antonio Torralba, Jonathan Lorraine</p>
            <p>We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04615v1" target="_blank">Improved Predictions on Higgs-Starobinsky Inflation and Reheating with   ACT DR6 and Primordial Gravitational Waves</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Riajul Haque, Sourav Pal, Debarun Paul</p>
            <p>We investigate the implications of recent CMB observations for Higgs-Starobinsky inflationary models and their associated reheating dynamics, utilizing data from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. In addition to direct CMB constraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through limits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially relevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state $w_{\rm RH}\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of inflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the $2\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature is constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\rm RH} > 0.41$. However, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\sigma$ C.L. once $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the Higgs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04614v1" target="_blank">Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Cheek, Anish Ghoshal, Debarun Paul</p>
            <p>We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the GW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the sensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant parameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW detectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04607v1" target="_blank">Experimental demonstration of a multi-particle collective measurement   for optimal quantum state estimation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Mansouri, Kyle M. Jordan, Jeff S. Lundeen</p>
            <p>We experimentally demonstrate a two-particle collective measurement proposed as the optimal solution to a quantum state estimation game. Our results suggest that, in practice, the collective measurement strategy is at least as good as the best local approach, and it achieves a higher average fidelity when accounting for systematic errors. This photonic implementation uses a recently developed universal two-photon projective measurement based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, polarization-dependent loss, and unitary operations. We compare the performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement is suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state tomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total number of samples.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17774v3" target="_blank">Uncertainty for SVBRDF Acquisition using Frequency Analysis</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Wiersma, Julien Philip, Miloš Hašan, Krishna Mullia, Fujun Luan, Elmar Eisemann, Valentin Deschaintre</p>
            <p>This paper aims to quantify uncertainty for SVBRDF acquisition in multi-view captures. Under uncontrolled illumination and unstructured viewpoints, there is no guarantee that the observations contain enough information to reconstruct the appearance properties of a captured object. We study this ambiguity, or uncertainty, using entropy and accelerate the analysis by using the frequency domain, rather than the domain of incoming and outgoing viewing angles. The result is a method that computes a map of uncertainty over an entire object within a millisecond. We find that the frequency model allows us to recover SVBRDF parameters with competitive performance, that the accelerated entropy computation matches results with a physically-based path tracer, and that there is a positive correlation between error and uncertainty. We then show that the uncertainty map can be applied to improve SVBRDF acquisition using capture guidance, sharing information on the surface, and using a diffusion model to inpaint uncertain regions. Our code is available at https://github.com/rubenwiersma/svbrdf_uncertainty.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20006v2" target="_blank">Exploiting a Shortcoming of Coupled-Cluster Theory: The Extent of   non-Hermiticity as a Diagnostic Indicator of Computational Accuracy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaila E. Weflen, Megan R. Bentley, James H. Thorpe, Peter R. Franke, Jan M. L. Martin, Devin A. Matthews, John F. Stanton</p>
            <p>The fundamental non-Hermitian nature of the forms of coupled-cluster (CC) theory widely used in quantum chemistry has usually been viewed as a negative, but the present letter shows how this can be used to advantage. Specifically, the non-symmetric nature of the reduced one-particle density matrix (in the molecular orbital basis) is advocated as a diagnostic indicator of computational quality. In the limit of full coupled-cluster theory (which is equivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI)), the electronic wavefunction and correlation energy are exact within a given one-particle basis set and the symmetric character of the exact density matrix is recovered. The extent of the density matrix asymmetry is shown to provide a measure of ``how difficult the problem is'' (like the well-known T$_1$ diagnostic), but its variation with level of theory also gives information about ``how well this particular method works'', irrespective of the difficulty of the problem at hand. The proposed diagnostic is described and applied to a select group of small molecules, and an example of its overall utility for the practicing quantum chemist is illustrated through its application to the beryllium dimer (Be$_2$). Future applications of this idea to excited states, open-shell systems, symmetry-breaking problems and extension of the method to the two-particle density are then proposed.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04598v1" target="_blank">Post-selection free time-bin entanglement on a thin-film lithium niobate   photonic chip</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcello Bacchi, Andrea Bernardi, Marco Clementi, Sara Congia, Francesco Garrisi, Andrea Martellosio, Marco Passoni, Alexander Wrobel, Federico Andrea Sabattoli, Matteo Galli, Daniele Bajoni</p>
            <p>Time-bin entanglement is the most commonly used form of entanglement for quantum communication protocols over fiber networks, due to the natural resilience of this encoding scheme to thermal phase fluctuations in optical fibers. Projective measurements on some bases in the time-bin encoding need, however, post-selection of the measured events, introducing a loophole in Bell tests and requiring high temporal resolution. In this work, we demonstrate chip-integrated receivers for time-bin entanglement certification including a high-speed optical switch to remove such post-selection loophole. The receivers are realized using thin-film lithium niobate and operate at a switching frequency of 5 GHz, enabling high secure key rates. We demonstrate a Bell inequality violation by more than 24 standard deviations without the need for time resolution at the time-bin separation level.</p>
