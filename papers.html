            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13956v1" target="_blank">Imaging the Photochemistry of Cyclobutanone using Ultrafast Electron   Diffraction: Experimental Results</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. E. Green, Y. Liu, F. Allum, M. Gra√ül, P. Lenzen, M. N. R. Ashfold, S. Bhattacharyya, X. Cheng, M. Centurion, S. W. Crane, R. G. Forbes, N. A. Goff, L.

Weber, H. Zhao, T. J. A. Wolf</p>
            <p>We investigated the ultrafast structural dynamics of cyclobutanone following photoexcitation at $\lambda=200$ nm using gas-phase megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. Our investigation complements the simulation studies of the same process within this special issue. It provides information about both electronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable inelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the depopulation of the photoexcited S$_2$ state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg character through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time constant of $(0.29 \pm 0.2)$ ps towards the S$_1$ state. The S$_1$ state population undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while passing through a conical intersection with S$_0$. The corresponding structural changes can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes appear with a delay of $(0.14 \pm 0.05)$ ps with respect the initial photoexcitation, which is less than the S$_2$ depopulation time constant. This behavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once the S$_1$ state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further within $(1.2 \pm 0.2)$ ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene and ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide. Our study showcases both the value of gas-phase ultrafast diffraction studies as an experimental benchmark for nonadiabatic dynamics simulation methods and the limits in the interpretation of such experimental data without comparison to such simulations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11661v3" target="_blank">Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and   its application to the functional renormalization group</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miriam Patricolo, Marcel Gievers, Kilian Fraboulet, Aiman Al-Eryani, Sarah Heinzelmann, Pietro M. Bonetti, Alessandro Toschi, Demetrio Vilardi, Sabine Andergassen</p>
            <p>We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03315v2" target="_blank">Robotic Table Tennis: A Case Study into a High Speed Learning System</a></h3>

            <p>We present a deep-dive into a real-world robotic learning system that, in previous work, was shown to be capable of hundreds of table tennis rallies with a human and has the ability to precisely return the ball to desired targets. This system puts together a highly optimized perception subsystem, a high-speed low-latency robot controller, a simulation paradigm that can prevent damage in the real world and also train policies for zero-shot transfer, and automated real world environment resets that enable autonomous training and evaluation on physical robots. We complement a complete system description, including numerous design decisions that are typically not widely disseminated, with a collection of studies that clarify the importance of mitigating various sources of latency, accounting for training and deployment distribution shifts, robustness of the perception system, sensitivity to policy hyper-parameters, and choice of action space. A video demonstrating the components of the system and details of experimental results can be found at https://youtu.be/uFcnWjB42I0.</p>

            <p>Microcalorimeter instruments aboard future X-ray observatories will require an anti-coincidence (anti-co) detector to veto charged particle events and reduce the non-X-ray background. We have developed a large-format, TES-based prototype anti-coincidence detector that is particularly suitable for use with spatially-extended (~ 10 cm^2}) TES microcalorimeter arrays, as would be used for a future large field-of-view X-ray missions. This prototype was developed in the context of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM) probe concept, which required a ~ 14 cm^2 anti-co detector with > 95% live time and a low-energy threshold below 20 keV. Our anti-co design employs parallel networks of quasiparticle-trap-assisted electrothermal feedback TESs (QETs) to detect the athermal phonon signal produced in the detector substrate by incident charged particles. We developed multiple prototype anti-co designs featuring 12 channels and up to 6300 QETs. Here we focus on a design utilizing tungsten TESs and present characterization results. Broad energy range measurements have been performed (4.1 keV -- 5.5 MeV). Based on noise and responsivity measurements, the implied low-energy threshold is < 1 keV and a live time fraction of > 96% can be achieved up to 5.5 MeV. We also find evidence of mm-scale-or-better spatial resolution and discuss the potential utility of this for future missions. Finally, we discuss the early development of a soild-state physics model of the anti-co towards understanding phonon propagation and quasiparticle production in the detector.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03705v3" target="_blank">Bratteli networks and the Spectral Action on quivers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos I. Perez-Sanchez</p>
            <p>In the context of noncommutative geometry, we consider quiver representations -- not on vector spaces, as traditional, but on finite-dimensional prespectral triples (`discrete topological noncommutative spaces'). A similar idea appeared in the original work of Marcolli-van Suijlekom on quiver representations in spectral triples (`discrete noncommutative geometries'), which paved the way for some of our results in independent directions. We introduce Bratteli networks, a structure that yields a neat combinatorial characterisation of the space $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$ of prespectral-triple-representations of a quiver $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$, as well as of the gauge group and of their quotient. Not only these claims that make it possible to `integrate over $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$' are, as we now argue, in line with the spirit of random noncommutative geometry -- formulating path integrals over Dirac operators -- but they also contain a physically relevant case. Namely, the equivalence between quiver representations and path algebra modules, established here for the new category, inspired the following construction: Only from representation theory data, we build a spectral triple for the quiver and evaluate the spectral action functional from a general formula over closed paths. When we apply this construction to lattice-quivers, we obtain not only Wilsonian Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, but also the Weisz-Wohlert-cells in the context of Symanzik's improved gauge theory. We show that a hermitian (`Higgs') matrix field emerges from the self-loops of the quiver and derive the Yang-Mills--Higgs theory on flat space as a smooth limit.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07353v2" target="_blank">Pre-detection squeezing as a resource for high-dimensional Bell-state   measurements</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Bianchi, Carlo Marconi, Jan Sperling, Davide Bacco</p>
            <p>Bell measurements, entailing the projection onto one of the Bell states, play a key role in quantum information and communication, where the outcome of a variety of protocols crucially depends on the success probability of such measurements. Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be implemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer true for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In order to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear effects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell measurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer devices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different Bell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by the dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus paving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell measurement.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06291v2" target="_blank">Four Total Eclipsing Contact Binary Systems: The First Photometric Light   Curve Solutions Employing TESS and Gaia Surveys</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atila Poro, Razieh Aliakbari, Hossein Azarara, Asma Ababafi, Sadegh Nasirian</p>
            <p>We presented the first photometric light curve solutions of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems. This investigation utilized photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We used the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for these light curve solutions. Only TIC 249064185 among the target systems needed a cold starspot to be included in the analysis. Based on the estimated mass ratios for these total eclipse systems, three of them are categorized as low mass ratio contact binary stars. The absolute parameters of the systems were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax method and the orbital period and semi-major axis ($P-a$) empirical relationship. We defined that TIC 318015356 and TIC 55522736 systems are A-subtypes, while TIC 249064185 and TIC 397984843 are W-subtypes, depending on each component's effective temperature and mass. We estimated the initial masses of the stars, the mass lost by the binary system, and the systems' ages. We displayed star positions in the mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and total mass-orbital angular momentum diagrams. In addition, our findings indicate a good agreement with the mass-temperature empirical parameter relationship for the primary stars.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13944v1" target="_blank">Emergence of Scale-Free Traffic Jams in Highway Networks: A   Probabilistic Approach</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agnieszka Janicka, Fiona Sloothaak, Maria Vlasiou, Bert Zwart</p>
            <p>Traffic congestion continues to escalate with urbanization and socioeconomic development, necessitating advanced modeling to understand and mitigate its impacts. In large-scale networks, traffic congestion can be studied using cascade models, where congestion not only impacts isolated segments, but also propagates through the network in a domino-like fashion. One metric for understanding these impacts is congestion cost, which is typically defined as the additional travel time caused by traffic jams. Recent data suggests that congestion cost exhibits a universal scale-free-tailed behavior. However, the mechanism driving this phenomenon is not yet well understood. To address this gap, we propose a stochastic cascade model of traffic congestion. We show that traffic congestion cost is driven by the scale-free distribution of traffic intensities. This arises from the catastrophe principle, implying that severe congestion is likely caused by disproportionately large traffic originating from a single location. We also show that the scale-free nature of congestion cost is robust to various congestion propagation rules, explaining the universal scaling observed in empirical data. These findings provide a new perspective in understanding the fundamental drivers of traffic congestion and offer a unifying framework for studying congestion phenomena across diverse traffic networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03127v2" target="_blank">Fast algorithms to improve fair information access in networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Robert Windham, Caroline J. Wendt, Alex Crane, Madelyn J Warr, Freda Shi, Sorelle A. Friedler, Blair D. Sullivan, Aaron Clauset</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of selecting $k$ seed nodes in a network to maximize the minimum probability of activation under an independent cascade beginning at these seeds. The motivation is to promote fairness by ensuring that even the least advantaged members of the network have good access to information. Our problem can be viewed as a variant of the classic influence maximization objective, but it appears somewhat more difficult to solve: only heuristics are known. Moreover, the scalability of these methods is sharply constrained by the need to repeatedly estimate access probabilities.   We design and evaluate a suite of $10$ new scalable algorithms which crucially do not require probability estimation. To facilitate comparison with the state-of-the-art, we make three more contributions which may be of broader interest. We introduce a principled method of selecting a pairwise information transmission parameter used in experimental evaluations, as well as a new performance metric which allows for comparison of algorithms across a range of values for the parameter $k$. Finally, we provide a new benchmark corpus of $174$ networks drawn from $6$ domains. Our algorithms retain most of the performance of the state-of-the-art while reducing running time by orders of magnitude. Specifically, a meta-learner approach is on average only $20\%$ less effective than the state-of-the-art on held-out data, but about $75-130$ times faster. Further, the meta-learner's performance exceeds the state-of the-art on about $20\%$ of networks, and the magnitude of its running time advantage is maintained on much larger networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13941v1" target="_blank">Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient   Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Bau, Andreas Aigner, Jonas Biechteler, Connor Heimig, Thorsten Goelz, Stefan A. Maier, Andreas Tittl</p>
            <p>Ultra-strong coupling (USC) is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths that substantially exceed the threshold for strong coupling. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric nanophotonic platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, we demonstrate ultra-strong coupling to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO$_2$ layer. Our approach leverages a dielectric dual-gradient metasurface supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (qBIC) consisting of two tapered bars in each unit cell that generate strong out-of-plane electric fields which overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode. Using dual gradients to encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space, we track the anticrossing behaviour of this coupled system with high experimental precision, revealing a mode splitting equivalent to 19% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, varying the position of the SiO$_2$ layer allows for deliberate control of the mode overlap and the coupling between the qBIC and either the ENZ mode or the transverse optical (TO) phonon can be selectively tuned. This allows us to experimentally create an USC three-resonator system, opening new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices for sensing and nonlinear optics.</p>
