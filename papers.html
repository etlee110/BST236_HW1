            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07226v2" target="_blank">Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via   Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You</p>
            <p>The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13596v2" target="_blank">First Observation of Antiproton Annihilation At Rest on Argon in the   LArIAT Experiment</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Basque, R. Acciarri, J. Asaadi, M. Backfish, W. Badgett, F. Cavanna, W. Flanagan, W. Foreman, R. A. Gomes, E. Gramellini, M. A. Hernandez-Morquecho, J.

            <p>We report the first observation and measurement of antiproton annihilation at rest on argon using the LArIAT experiment. Antiprotons from a charged particle test beam that come to rest inside LArIAT's liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) are identified through beamline instrumentation and LArTPC track reconstruction algorithms. The multiplicity of charged particle tracks originating from the annihilation vertex is manually assessed through hand-scanning, resulting in a distribution with a mean of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 tracks and a standard deviation of 1.3 tracks. This is consistent with an automated track reconstruction, which produces a mean of 2.8 $\pm$ 0.4 tracks and a standard deviation of 1.2 tracks. Good agreement is found between data and Monte Carlo simulations for both methods. Additionally, we report the shower multiplicity and particle identification of outgoing tracks, both of which align closely with theoretical predictions. These findings will contribute to modeling of intranuclear annihilation interactions on argon, including scenarios such as neutron-antineutron oscillations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14670v1" target="_blank">Quantum Optimization via Gradient-Based Hamiltonian Descent</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Leng, Bin Shi</p>
            <p>With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20150v2" target="_blank">Shot-noise in strongly-correlated double quantum spin Hall edges</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann</p>
            <p>We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moir\'e twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14165v2" target="_blank">On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Yan, Sara Murciano, Pasquale Calabrese, Robert Konik</p>
            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14661v1" target="_blank">Abacus: A Cost-Based Optimizer for Semantic Operator Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Russo, Sivaprasad Sudhir, Gerardo Vitagliano, Chunwei Liu, Tim Kraska, Samuel Madden, Michael Cafarella</p>
            <p>LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters, joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction, summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most (if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator performance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering (MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2% better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next best system.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11750v2" target="_blank">Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer   Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanxiang Hua, Ryan Sobash, David John Gagne II, Yingkai Sha, Alexandra Anderson-Frey</p>
            <p>Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14652v2" target="_blank">General-Reasoner: Advancing LLM Reasoning Across All Domains</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueguang Ma, Qian Liu, Dongfu Jiang, Ge Zhang, Zejun Ma, Wenhu Chen</p>
            <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14649v1" target="_blank">Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic   multilayers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. J. Dubicki, V. V. Slastikov, A. Bernand-Mantel, C. B. Muratov</p>
            <p>This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer   heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of   spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such   magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible   hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the   next generation of low power information technologies and   unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the   adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,   whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing   role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive   a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin   ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline   anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime   in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange   interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description   governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a   function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of   theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers   exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the   simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and   completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the   global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray   field-stabilized N\'eel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane   magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two   skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation   distance.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18402v2" target="_blank">Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles   to large-amplitude oscillatory fields</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ilg</p>
            <p>Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.</p>
