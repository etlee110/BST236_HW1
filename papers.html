            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10626v1" target="_blank">NIL: No-data Imitation Learning by Leveraging Pre-trained Video   Diffusion Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mert Albaba, Chenhao Li, Markos Diomataris, Omid Taheri, Andreas Krause, Michael Black</p>
            <p>Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19478v2" target="_blank">Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a   classically conformal dark sector</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sowmiya Balan, Torsten Bringmann, Felix Kahlhoefer, Jonas Matuszak, Carlo Tasillo</p>
            <p>Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10623v1" target="_blank">Fast Sideband Control of a Weakly Coupled Multimode Bosonic Memory</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan Huang, Thomas J. DiNapoli, Gavin Rockwood, Ming Yuan, Prathyankara Narasimhan, Eesh Gupta, Mustafa Bal, Francesco Crisa, Sabrina Garattoni, Yao Lu, Liang Jiang, Srivatsan Chakram</p>
            <p>Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) with superconducting cavities coupled to nonlinear circuits like transmons offers a promising platform for hardware-efficient quantum information processing. We address critical challenges in realizing this architecture by weakening the dispersive coupling while also demonstrating fast, high-fidelity multimode control by dynamically amplifying gate speeds through transmon-mediated sideband interactions. This approach enables transmon-cavity SWAP gates, for which we achieve speeds up to 30 times larger than the bare dispersive coupling. Combined with transmon rotations, this allows for efficient, universal state preparation in a single cavity mode, though achieving unitary gates and extending control to multiple modes remains a challenge. In this work, we overcome this by introducing two sideband control strategies: (1) a shelving technique that prevents unwanted transitions by temporarily storing populations in sideband-transparent transmon states and (2) a method that exploits the dispersive shift to synchronize sideband transition rates across chosen photon-number pairs to implement transmon-cavity SWAP gates that are selective on photon number. We leverage these protocols to prepare Fock and binomial code states across any of ten modes of a multimode cavity with millisecond cavity coherence times. We demonstrate the encoding of a qubit from a transmon into arbitrary vacuum and Fock state superpositions, as well as entangled NOON states of cavity mode pairs\textemdash a scheme extendable to arbitrary multimode Fock encodings. Furthermore, we implement a new binomial encoding gate that converts arbitrary transmon superpositions into binomial code states in $\qty{4}{\micro\second}$ (less than $1/\chi$), achieving an average post-selected final state fidelity of $\qty{96.3}{\percent}$ across different fiducial input states.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04985v3" target="_blank">Hovering Flight in Flapping Insects and Hummingbirds: A Natural   Real-Time and Stable Extremum Seeking Feedback System</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed A. Elgohary, Sameh A. Eisa</p>
            <p>In this paper, we take an initial and novel step towards characterizing the physical phenomenon of hovering flight as an extremum seeking (ES) feedback system. We anticipate that said novel characterization may start a new line of research that can potentially solve all the puzzle pieces of hovering flight that existed for decades in previous literature. Is hovering flight stable? If so, what is the control mechanism utilized by insects/hummingbirds to achieve stable hovering? If such a mechanism exists, does it fit the biological constraints that insects/hummingbirds have limited computational abilities? Does it fit the experimental biology narrative that insects/hummingbirds rely mainly on their sensation to stabilize hovering? Our ES characterization and analysis provide for the first time a simple, model-free, real-time, stable feedback system of hovering. Consistent with natural observations and biological experiments, hovering via ES is simply achievable by the natural oscillations of the wing angle and measuring (sensing) altitude or acceleration. We provide simulation trials, including comparisons with some approaches from literature, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results. We used literature data for hawkmoth, cranefly, bumblebee, dragonfly, hoverfly, and a hummingbird.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10612v1" target="_blank">Approximation technique for preserving the minimum principle on the   entropy for the compressible Euler Equations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bennett Clayton, Eric J. Tovar</p>
            <p>This paper is concerned with constructing an invariant-domain preserving approximation technique for the compressible Euler equations that preserves the minimum principle on the physical entropy. We show that any numerical method that can be written as a convex combination of good auxiliary states will satisfy the minimum principle on the physical entropy provided the equation of state satisfies some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive a wave speed estimate in an extended Riemann problem necessary for constructing the auxiliary states with desired properties. Finally, we numerically illustrate the proposed methodology.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10610v1" target="_blank">Searching for strong lensing by late-type galaxies in UNIONS</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. A. Acevedo Barroso, B. Cl√©ment, F. Courbin, R. Gavazzi, C. Lemon, K. Rojas, D. Scott, S. Gwyn, F. Hammer, M. J. Hudson, E. A. Magnier</p>
            <p>Recent wide-field galaxy surveys have led to an explosion in numbers of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidates. However, the vast majority feature massive luminous red galaxies as the main deflectors, with late-type galaxies being vastly under-represented. This work presents a dedicated search for lensing by edge-on late-type galaxies in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). The search covers $3600$ deg$^2$ of $r$-band observations taken from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We consider all sources with magnitudes in the range $17 < r < 20.5$, without any colour preselection, yielding a parent sample of seven million sources. We characterise our parent sample via the visual inspection of $120\,000$ sources selected at random. From it, we estimate, with a 68\% confidence interval, that 1 in every $30\,000$ sources is an edge-on lens candidate, with at least eight high-quality candidates in the parent sample. This corresponds to 1 candidate per $17\,000$ edge-on late-type galaxies. Our search relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to select a reduced sample of candidates, followed by a visual inspection to curate the final sample. The CNN is trained from scratch using simulated $r$-band observations of edge-on lenses, and real observations of non-lenses. We find 61 good edge-on lens candidates using the CNN. Moreover, combining the CNN candidates with those found serendipitously, and those identified while characterising the parent sample, we discovered 4 grade A, 20 grade B, and 58 grade C edge-on lens candidates; effectively doubling the known sample of these systems. We also discovered 16 grade A, 16 grade B, and 18 grade C lens candidates of other types. Finally, based on the characterisation of the parent sample, we estimate that our search found around 60\% of the bright grade A and B edge-on lens candidates within the parent sample.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10607v1" target="_blank">Utilizing discrete variable representations for decoherence-accurate   numerical simulation of superconducting circuits</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brittany Richman, C. J. Lobb, Jacob M. Taylor</p>
            <p>Given the prevalence of superconducting platforms for uses in quantum computing and quantum sensing, the simulation of quantum superconducting circuits has become increasingly important for identifying system characteristics and modeling their relevant dynamics. Various numerical tools and software packages have been developed with this purpose in mind, typically utilizing the harmonic oscillator basis or the charge basis to represent a Hamiltonian. In this work, we instead consider the use of discrete variable representations (DVRs) to model superconducting circuits. In particular, we use `sinc DVRs' of both charge number and phase to approximate the eigenenergies of several prototypical examples, exploring their use and effectiveness in the numerical analysis of superconducting circuits. We find that not only are these DVRs capable of achieving decoherence-accurate simulation, i.e., accuracy at the resolution of experiments subject to decay, decoherence, and dephasing, they also demonstrate improvements in efficiency with smaller basis sizes and better convergence over standard approaches, showing that DVRs are an advantageous alternative for representing superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05693v3" target="_blank">Dynamics of disordered quantum systems with two- and three-dimensional   tensor networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Tindall, Antonio Mello, Matt Fishman, Miles Stoudenmire, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [A. D. King et al, Science, 10.1126/science.ado6285 (2025)] and, following extensive comparisons to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. We exploit the scalability of our simulations and simulate a system of over $300$ qubits, allowing us to verify the universal physics present and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04139v2" target="_blank">Diophantine equations with sum of cubes and cube of sum</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bogdan A. Dobrescu, Patrick J. Fox</p>
            <p>We solve Diophantine equations of the type $ a \, (x^3 \!+ \! y^3 \!+ \! z^3 ) = (x \! + \! y \! + \! z)^3$, where $x,y,z$ are integer variables, and the coefficient $a\neq 0$ is rational. We show that there are infinite families of such equations, including those where $a$ is any cube or certain rational fractions, that have nontrivial solutions. There are also infinite families of equations that do not have any nontrivial solution, including those where $1/a = 1- 24/m$ with restrictions on the integer $m$. The equations can be represented by elliptic curves unless $a = 9$ or 1, and any elliptic curve of nonzero $j$-invariant and torsion group $\mathbb{Z}/3k\mathbb{Z}$ for $k = 2,3,4$, or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} $ corresponds to a particular $a$. We prove that for any $a$ the number of nontrivial solutions is at most 3 or is infinite, and for integer $a$ it is either 0 or $\infty$. For $a = 9$, we find the general solution, which depends on two integer parameters. These cubic equations are important in particle physics, because they determine the fermion charges under the $U(1)$ gauge group.</p>
