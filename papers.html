            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20141v1" target="_blank">Sublimation of orientated amino acid films for reliable, amplified   piezoelectric performance</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciaran O Malley, Muhammad Usaid Memon, Krishna Hari, Tara Ryan, Sarah Guerin</p>
            <p>Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20132v1" target="_blank">Tensorization is a powerful but underexplored tool for compression and   interpretability of neural networks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Safa Hamreras, Sukhbinder Singh, Román Orús</p>
            <p>Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20125v1" target="_blank">Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction   strength</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori</p>
            <p>In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20116v1" target="_blank">The finite-difference parquet method: Enhanced electron-paramagnon   scattering opens a pseudogap</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Mo Lihm, Dominik Kiese, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Fabian B. Kugler</p>
            <p>We present the finite-difference parquet method that greatly improves the applicability and accuracy of two-particle correlation approaches to interacting electron systems. This method incorporates the nonperturbative local physics from a reference solution and builds all parquet diagrams while circumventing potentially divergent irreducible vertices. Its unbiased treatment of different fluctuations is crucial for reproducing the strong-coupling pseudogap in the underdoped Hubbard model, consistent with diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. We reveal a strong-coupling spin-fluctuation mechanism of the pseudogap with decisive vertex corrections that encode the cooperation of direct- and exchange-type scattering between electrons and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20114v1" target="_blank">Tri-band Aperture-shared Antenna Array Using Scalable FSS-based   Electromagnetic Transparent Structure</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongzheng Li, Wanchen Yang, Quan Xue, Wenquan Che</p>
            <p>A novel dual-band electromagnetic transparent structure (DBTS) is firstly proposed and used to realize a tri-band aperture-shared antenna array. The DBTS achieves two tunable electromagnetic transparent frequency bands by periodically loading capacitive patches and meander lines to an inductive strip. Meanwhile, the DBTS features flexible frequency band scalability by loading additional serial L-C tanks. In tri-band aperture-shared arrays, the low-band (LB) dipole induces a deterioration in the radiation pattern of the middle-band (MB) and high-band (HB) antennas as a consequence of the shielding effects. To address this issue, the DBTS is utilized to construct the LB dipole, with its electromagnetic transparent bands allocated at MB and HB simultaneously. Consequently, a tri-band aperture-shared array is realized by combining the LB dipole with a dual-band subarray that operates at MB and HB within a shared aperture. The proposed array realizes an aperture-shared operation within the frequency ranges covering 0.65-0.88GHz (LB), 1.92-2.18GHz (MB) and 3.3-3.8GHz (HB). The LB dipole induces minimal shielding to the MB and HB antennas, resulting in their restored radiation performance with broadside gain deviation of less than 0.6dB.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17490v2" target="_blank">DTRT: Enhancing Human Intent Estimation and Role Allocation for Physical   Human-Robot Collaboration</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Liu, Yuchuang Tong, Zhengtao Zhang</p>
            <p>In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration. Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation, achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20108v1" target="_blank">Classical-to-quantum transfer of geometric phase for non-interferometric   phase measurement and manipulation of quantum state</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vimlesh Kumar, Chahat Kaushik, M. Ebrahim-Zadeh, C. M. Chandrashekar, G. K. Samanta</p>
            <p>The geometric phase, originating from the cyclic evolution of a state, such as polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, is typically measured through interferometric approaches that often include unwanted contributions from the dynamic phase. Here, we present a non-interferometric technique based on quantum correlation of pair photons to measure the geometric phase of a classical beam. The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20105v1" target="_blank">Realistic Multi-temperature Dust: How Well Can We Constrain the Dust   Properties of High-redshift Galaxies?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Sommovigo, Hiddo Algera</p>
            <p>Determining the dust properties of high-redshift galaxies from their far-infrared continuum emission is challenging due to limited multi-frequency data. As a result, the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) is often modeled as a single-temperature modified blackbody. We assess the accuracy of the single-temperature approximation by constructing realistic dust SEDs using a physically motivated prescription where the dust temperature probability distribution function (PDF) is described by a skewed normal distribution. This approach captures the complexity of the mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted temperature PDFs of simulated galaxies and quasars, and yields far-infrared SEDs that match high-redshift observations. We explore how varying the mean temperature ($\bar{T}_d$), width, and skewness of the temperature PDF affects the recovery of the dust mass, IR luminosity, and dust emissivity index $\beta_d$ at z=7. Fitting the dust SEDs with a single-temperature approximation, we find that dust masses are generally well-recovered, although they may be underestimated by up to 0.6 dex for broad temperature distributions with a low $\bar{T}_d <$ 40 K, as seen in some high-redshift quasars and/or evolved galaxies. IR luminosities are generally recovered within the $1\sigma$ uncertainty (< 0.3 dex), except at $\bar{T}_d >$ 80 K, where the peak shifts well beyond ALMA's wavelength coverage. The inferred dust emissivity index is consistently shallower than the input one ($\beta_d$=2) due to the effect of multi-temperature dust, suggesting that a steep $\beta_d$ may probe dust composition and grain size variations. With larger galaxy samples and well-sampled dust SEDs, systematic errors from multi-temperature dust may dominate over fitting uncertainties and should thus be considered.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16381v5" target="_blank">PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path   Discovery in Molecular Systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus Petersen, Roberto Covino</p>
            <p>Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p>
