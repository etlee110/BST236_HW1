            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16931v1" target="_blank">Lattice study of $cc\bar u\bar s$ tetraquark channel in   $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ scattering</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanishk Shrimal, Sara Collins, Priyajit Jana, M. Padmanath, Sasa Prelovsek</p>
            <p>We present the first lattice QCD determination of coupled $DD_s^*$ and $D^*D_s$ scattering amplitudes in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ channel and elastic $DD_s$ scattering amplitude in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel.The aim is to investigate whether tetraquarks with flavor $cc\bar u\bar s$ exist in the region near threshold. Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\pi} \sim 280$ MeV, $a\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra are determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices, computed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures within the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$ is determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames following L\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of Lippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We observe small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the noninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather weak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero energy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry signatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy region near the threshold.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11569v2" target="_blank">Blazar Boosted ALP and vector portal Dark matter confronting light   mediator searches</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Jeesun</p>
            <p>The trouble in detecting low mass dark matter due to its low kinetic energy can be ameliorated in the boosted dark matter framework, where a sub-population of galactic dark matter attains very high energy after being up-scattered by energetic standard model particles. However, in such a scenario the upper limits on the cross-section obtained hitherto are typically large. Hence in the minimal extension of standard model where new mediators act as a portal between the dark and visible sectors, the direct detection limits for sub-GeV dark matter might lie within the exclusion region of other ground based searches of the mediator. To evade this deadlock, we allude to blazar boosted dark matter electron scattering in multi-ton neutrino detector Super kamiokande. We consider minimal models such as axion like particle (ALP) and vector portal dark matter being upscattered by high energy blazar jet and analyse the interesting parameter reaches from Super kamiokande in the parameter space of the mediator, surpassing the existing constraints. Besides, this scenario exhibits stronger limits for previously unexplored ALP mediated sub-MeV dark matter search which is difficult due to associated momentum suppression.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08641v3" target="_blank">Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated   single band for matrix models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanwen Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16928v1" target="_blank">Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A   comparison of single- and two-color schemes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Troß, Travis Severt, eorgios Kolliopoulos, Pratap Timilsina, Itzik Ben-Itzhak, Carlos A. Trallero-Herrero</p>
            <p>We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01892v2" target="_blank">Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clelia Altomonte, Alan J. Barr, Michał Eckstein, Paweł Horodecki, Kazuki Sakurai</p>
            <p>In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and, at the same time, constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04316v2" target="_blank">Shape-asymmetry and flexibility in active cross-stream migration in   nonuniform shear</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek C. Gomes, Tapan C. Adhyapak</p>
            <p>We show that activity and broken fore-aft shape symmetry enable microswimmers to cross streamlines in nonuniform shear, a key yet overlooked factor in active cross-stream migration. Using a model of flagellated microswimmers in microchannel flow, we find that hydrodynamic coupling and flagellar flexibility significantly impact migration. A simplified theory identifies key factors driving the underlying rich nonlinear dynamics. Our findings apply to dynamics and control of both living and artificial microswimmers, while the hydrodynamic framework extends to diverse shear flow scenarios.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05938v2" target="_blank">Energy-Efficient Autonomous Aerial Navigation with Dynamic Vision   Sensors: A Physics-Guided Neuromorphic Approach</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Sanyal, Amogh Joshi, Manish Nagaraj, Rohan Kumar Manna, Kaushik Roy</p>
            <p>Vision-based object tracking is a critical component for achieving autonomous aerial navigation, particularly for obstacle avoidance. Neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) or event cameras, inspired by biological vision, offer a promising alternative to conventional frame-based cameras. These cameras can detect changes in intensity asynchronously, even in challenging lighting conditions, with a high dynamic range and resistance to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly used to process these event-based signals efficiently and asynchronously. Meanwhile, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) provides a means to incorporate system-level knowledge into neural networks via physical modeling. This enhances robustness, energy efficiency, and provides symbolic explainability. In this work, we present a neuromorphic navigation framework for autonomous drone navigation. The focus is on detecting and navigating through moving gates while avoiding collisions. We use event cameras for detecting moving objects through a shallow SNN architecture in an unsupervised manner. This is combined with a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) trained with depth inputs to predict optimal flight times, generating near-minimum energy paths. The system is implemented in the Gazebo simulator and integrates a sensor-fused vision-to-planning neuro-symbolic framework built with the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware. This work highlights the future potential of integrating event-based vision with physics-guided planning for energy-efficient autonomous navigation, particularly for low-latency decision-making.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16924v1" target="_blank">Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform   Ground States</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeuk Kim, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16920v1" target="_blank">Summary statistics of learning link changing neural representations to   behavior</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>How can we make sense of large-scale recordings of neural activity across learning? Theories of neural network learning with their origins in statistical physics offer a potential answer: for a given task, there are often a small set of summary statistics that are sufficient to predict performance as the network learns. Here, we review recent advances in how summary statistics can be used to build theoretical understanding of neural network learning. We then argue for how this perspective can inform the analysis of neural data, enabling better understanding of learning in biological and artificial neural networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16919v1" target="_blank">Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giandomenico Palumbo</p>
            <p>We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new axion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the axions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial boundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which shows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire half-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.</p>
