            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21773v1" target="_blank">Simulating quantum circuits with restricted quantum computers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christophe Piveteau</p>
            <p>It is one of the most fundamental objectives in quantum information science to understand the boundary between the computational power of classical and quantum computers. One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify classes of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical device, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device that is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study how the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such technique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the result of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces circuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum device.   The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of nonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical side, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple smaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit knitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the resource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation overhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels and we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate the utility of classical communication between the local parties. Our results address both the single-shot and asymptotic regime.   We frame QPS in a quantum resource theoretic framework, which highlights similarities that arise in the different instantiations of the technique. Furthermore, we study the importance of classical side information in the QPS procedure and how it impacts the overhead and expressibility of QPS.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21770v1" target="_blank">Visual Jenga: Discovering Object Dependencies via Counterfactual   Inpainting</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anand Bhattad, Konpat Preechakul, Alexei A. Efros</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel scene understanding task called Visual Jenga. Drawing inspiration from the game Jenga, the proposed task involves progressively removing objects from a single image until only the background remains. Just as Jenga players must understand structural dependencies to maintain tower stability, our task reveals the intrinsic relationships between scene elements by systematically exploring which objects can be removed while preserving scene coherence in both physical and geometric sense. As a starting point for tackling the Visual Jenga task, we propose a simple, data-driven, training-free approach that is surprisingly effective on a range of real-world images. The principle behind our approach is to utilize the asymmetry in the pairwise relationships between objects within a scene and employ a large inpainting model to generate a set of counterfactuals to quantify the asymmetry.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21765v1" target="_blank">Exploring the Evolution of Physics Cognition in Video Generation: A   Survey</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghui Lin, Xiang Wang, Yishan Wang, Shu Wang, Fengqi Dai, Pengxiang Ding, Cunxiang Wang, Zhengrong Zuo, Nong Sang, Siteng Huang, Donglin Wang</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in video generation have witnessed significant progress, especially with the rapid advancement of diffusion models. Despite this, their deficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention - generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling into the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity". Researchers began to increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video generation and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as motion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to simulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic overview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of architecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we discuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video generation from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier taxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of physical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world simulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and benchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this domain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to advancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through structured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide directional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically consistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models from the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like physical comprehension''.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19396v2" target="_blank">The Energy Spectrum of Kaon from Lattice QCD</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arunangshu Bora, Anirban Mandal, Shreya Mittal, Mihir N Pandey, Rohan Rana, Harsh Saxena, Priyajit Jana, Rijul Dhumane, Tanmoy Bhowmik, Martha Constantinou</p>
            <p>This study presents the analysis of data related to the two-point function of kaon generated from lattice QCD simulations. Using gauge configurations of twisted-mass fermions, we obtain the correlation functions for 6 values of momentum for the kaon between 0 and 2GeV (both inclusive), we use statistical techniques such as jackknife resampling to derive the energy of the particle. The lattice results are compared to the continuum dispersion relation for the particle, to assess systematic uncertainties in the lattice data. We establish consistency with theory by comparing our results with the theoretical predictions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21762v1" target="_blank">On the open TS/ST correspondence</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matijn François, Alba Grassi</p>
            <p>The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21755v1" target="_blank">VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic   Faithfulness</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dian Zheng, Ziqi Huang, Hongbo Liu, Kai Zou, Yinan He, Fan Zhang, Yuanhan Zhang, Jingwen He, Wei-Shi Zheng, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
            <p>Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21753v1" target="_blank">Quantum enhanced parameter estimation with monitored quantum   nonequilibrium systems using inefficient photo detection</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Cabot, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Many-body quantum systems hosting emergent collective behavior bear the promise to enable quantum enhanced parameter estimation. Formally this means that the variance of the parameter to be estimated decreases faster than $N^{-1}$, where $N$ is the number of particles forming the quantum system. In practice such scaling is challenging to achieve as the underlying many-body correlations are fragile. Moreover, devising the optimal measurements that indeed tap the quantum enhancement is often rather involved. Here we show that the inefficient detection of the photo emission from a dissipative quantum many-body system is sufficient to reach quantum enhanced parameter estimation even when some loss channels remain completely unmonitored. We illustrate our approach by considering the so-called boundary time-crystal, which is a nonequilibrium many-body system that has been realized recently experimentally in cold atomic gases. By analyzing the structure of the temporal correlations of its emission field, we are able to construct a family of near optimal parameter estimation measurements with a simple interferometric setup.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21750v1" target="_blank">Optical control of orbital magnetism in magic angle twisted bilayer   graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eylon Persky, Minhao He, Jiaqi Cai, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Xiaodong Xu, Aharon Kapitulnik</p>
            <p>Flat bands in graphene-based moir\'e structures host a wide range of emerging strongly correlated and topological phenomena. Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moir\'e fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21748v1" target="_blank">Extracting energy via bosonic Gaussian operations</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Ernesto Quintela Rodriguez, Francesco Anna Mele, Salvatore Francesco Emanuele Oliviero, Vittorio Giovannetti, Ludovico Lami, Vasco Cavina</p>
            <p>Quantum thermodynamics is often formulated as a theory with constrained access to operations and resources. In this manuscript, we find a closed formula for the Gaussian ergotropy, i.e. the maximum energy that can be extracted from bosonic systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians by means of Gaussian unitaries only. This formula resembles the well-known eigenvalue-based expression for the standard ergotropy, but is instead formulated using symplectic eigenvalues. We further prove that the Gaussian ergotropy is additive, indicating that the multiple-copy scenario does not benefit from Gaussian entangling operations. Extending our analysis to the relationship between ergotropic and entropic functions, we establish bounds linking entropic measures of Gaussianity to extractable work. Finally, we generalise our framework to open systems by studying the optimal state preparation that minimises the energy output in a Gaussian channel.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21746v1" target="_blank">Effects of dissipation on phase diagram and bosonic excitations in the   quark-meson model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes V. Roth, Yunxin Ye, Sören Schlichting, Lorenz von Smekal</p>
            <p>In this work we study the quark-meson model within a real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour. First, we discuss in detail the symmetry of thermal equilibrium for the fermionic sector of the Keldysh action. We take into account dissipation for the bosonic degrees of freedom in the spirit of the Caldeira-Leggett model by coupling the system to an $O(4)$ invariant external heat bath. We study the effect of dissipation on static equilibrium properties, most prominently on the FRG flow of the effective potential and thus on the resulting phase diagram. We find that, unlike in classical systems, through the contributions from non-zero Matsubara modes the dissipative dynamics can in general have an effect on static observables. We investigate these effects within two phenomenological models for the temperature dependence of the pion damping to verify that they are quantitatively small. To estimate their largest possible influence, we consider limits where the damping constants approach infinity.</p>
