            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10400v2" target="_blank">No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary   dynamics</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akira Sone, Akram Touil, Kenji Maeda, Paola Cappellaro, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00092v2" target="_blank">Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg</p>
            <p>We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19572v2" target="_blank">Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Stephen Powell, Juan P. Garrahan</p>
            <p>We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08520v2" target="_blank">Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar   Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murchana Khusroo, Ankita Thapa</p>
            <p>Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08059v3" target="_blank">Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in   $(d+1)$ dimensions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan</p>
            <p>We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d>1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09235v3" target="_blank">The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Juan P. Garrahan</p>
            <p>We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02553v2" target="_blank">Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Derek Khu, Andrew Tanggara, Chao Jin, Kishor Bharti</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with deep connections to entanglement, magic, and uncertainty relations. Entanglement, for instance, has driven key advances like surface codes and has deepened our understanding of quantum gravity through holographic quantum codes. While these connections are well-explored, the role of contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. Notably, Bell nonlocality is a special case of contextuality, and prior works have established contextuality as a key resource for quantum computational advantage.   In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. Using a sheaf-theoretic framework, we define contextuality for such codes and prove key results on its manifestation. Specifically, we prove the equivalence of definitions of contextuality from Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic framework and Kirby--Love's tree-based approach for the partial closure of Pauli measurement sets. We present several findings, including the proof of a recent conjecture posed by Kim and Abramsky. Working within the partial closure, we further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. As a consequence, we highlight that several protocols for code-switching between stabilizer codes, which admit a universal transversal gate set, are strongly contextual. Our findings reveal a direct connection between contextuality and quantum error correction, offering new insights into the nonclassical resources enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08273v3" target="_blank">Perturbative bootstrap of the Wilson-line defect CFT: Bulk-defect-defect   correlators</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Artico, Julien Barrat, Yingxuan Xu</p>
            <p>We study the correlators of bulk and defect half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with a Maldacena-Wilson line defect, focusing on the case involving one bulk and two defect local operators. We analyze the non-perturbative constraints on these correlators, which include a topological sector, pinching and splitting limits, as well as a compatibility with expanding in superconformal blocks. Using these constraints, we compute a variety of bulk-defect-defect correlators up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling, and observe that transcendental terms cancel. Additionally, we study the two leading terms in the strong-coupling regime, and present partial results for the next-to-next-to-leading order.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05381v4" target="_blank">The boundary entropy function for interface conformal field theories</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evangelos Afxonidis, Andreas Karch, Chitraang Murdia</p>
            <p>{In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17113v2" target="_blank">n-dimensional non-commutative GUP quantization and application to the   Bianchi I model</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastiano Segreto, Giovanni Montani</p>
            <p>We analyse a n-dimensional Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) quantization framework, characterized by a non-commutative nature of the configurational variables. First, we identify a set of states which are maximally localized only along a single direction, at the expense of being less localized in all the other ones. Subsequently, in order to recover information about localization on the whole configuration space, we use the only state of the theory which exhibits maximal localization simultaneously in every direction to construct a satisfactory quasi-position representation, by virtue of a suitable translational operator. The resultant quantum framework is then applied to model the dynamics of the Bianchi I cosmology. The corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation is reduced to Schr\"odinger dynamics for the two anisotropy degrees of freedom, using a WKB representation for the volume-like variable of the Universe, in accordance with the Vilenkin scenario. The main result of our cosmological implementation of the constructed quantum theory demonstrates how the dynamics of a wave packet peaked at some point in the configuration space represented in the quasi-position variables, favours as the most probable configuration exactly the initial one for a relatively long time, if compared with the ordinary quantum theory. This preference arises from the distinct behavioral dynamics exhibited by wave packets in the two quantum theories.</p>
