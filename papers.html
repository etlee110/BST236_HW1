            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06267v1" target="_blank">Prethermalization of light and matter in cavity-coupled Rydberg arrays</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06262v1" target="_blank">Paraxial fluids of light</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Glorieux, Clara Piekarski, Quentin Schibler, Tangui Aladjidi, Myrann Baker-Rasooli</p>
            <p>Paraxial fluids of light are a promising platform for exploring collective phenomena in a highly tunable environment. These systems, which map the propagation of light through nonlinear media onto the wavefunction of effective 2D quantum fluids, offer a complementary approach to traditional platforms such as cold atomic gases or superfluid helium. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the theoretical framework underlying paraxial fluids of light, including the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and its mapping to the 2D+1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). We explore the hydrodynamic formulation of these systems and we provide a comparative analysis of fluids of light and cold atomic gases, examining key parameters and figures of merit.   We then review the recent experimental advances and the experimental platforms currently used to realize paraxial fluids of light, including hot atomic vapors, photorefractive crystals, and thermo-optic media. Additionally, we question the geometry of the system extending the analogy from 2D+1 to lower or higher dimensions.   Looking forward, we outline the potential future directions for the field, including the use of laser cooled atoms as nonlinear media, the study of two-component mixtures, and the exploration of quantum effects beyond the mean-field approximation. These developments promise to deepen our understanding of quantum fluids and potentially contribute to advances in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06260v1" target="_blank">FEABench: Evaluating Language Models on Multiphysics Reasoning Ability</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nayantara Mudur, Hao Cui, Subhashini Venugopalan, Paul Raccuglia, Michael P. Brenner, Peter Norgaard</p>
            <p>Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06259v1" target="_blank">Realization and Calibration of Continuously Parameterized Two-Qubit   Gates on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher G. Yale, Ashlyn D. Burch, Matthew N. H. Chow, Brandon P. Ruzic, Daniel S. Lobser, Brian K. McFarland, Melissa C. Revelle, Susan M. Clark</p>
            <p>Continuously parameterized two-qubit gates are a key feature of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors as they have favorable error scalings and show distinct improvements in circuit performance over more restricted maximally entangling gatesets. In this work, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these continuously parameterized M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), a low-level trapped-ion processor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, $\theta$, we simply scale the amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing so requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the variable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate and cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual phase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a linear scaling between $\theta$ and the residual light shift. Once, we have considered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement with decreasing $\theta$. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to transform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06253v1" target="_blank">Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikrant Bhattachayra, Michael Capriotti, Reuben Tate</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18661v2" target="_blank">Stairway to discovery: a report on the CMS programme of cross section   measurements from millibarns to femtobarns</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong>  CMS Collaboration</p>
            <p>The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, delivering proton-proton collisions at much higher energies and far higher luminosities than previous machines, has enabled a comprehensive programme of measurements of the standard model (SM) processes by the CMS experiment. These unprecedented capabilities facilitate precise measurements of the properties of a wide array of processes, the most fundamental being cross sections. The discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass became the keystone of the SM. Knowledge of the mass of the Higgs boson allows precision comparisons of the predictions of the SM with the corresponding measurements. These measurements span the range from one of the most copious SM processes, the total inelastic cross section for proton-proton interactions, to the rarest ones, such as Higgs boson pair production. They cover the production of Higgs bosons, top quarks, single and multibosons, and hadronic jets. Associated parameters, such as coupling constants, are also measured. These cross section measurements can be pictured as a descending stairway, on which the lowest steps represent the rarest processes allowed by the SM, some never seen before.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06251v1" target="_blank">Moiré enhanced flat band in rhombohedral graphene</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyun Zhang, Jinxi Lu, Kai Liu, Yijie Wang, Fei Wang, Size Wu, Wanying Chen, Xuanxi Cai, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jose Avila, Pavel Dudin, Matthew D. Watson, Alex Louat, Takafumi Sato, Pu Yu, Wenhui Duan, Zhida Song, Guorui Chen, Shuyun Zhou</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moir\'e potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir\'e interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moir\'e potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moir\'e bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moir\'e potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06249v1" target="_blank">Electronic Structure Guided Inverse Design Using Generative Models</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyi Jia, Panchapakesan Ganesh, Victor Fung</p>
            <p>The electronic structure of a material fundamentally determines its underlying physical, and by extension, its functional properties. Consequently, the ability to identify or generate materials with desired electronic properties would enable the design of tailored functional materials. Traditional approaches relying on human intuition or exhaustive computational screening of known materials remain inefficient and resource-prohibitive for this task. Here, we introduce DOSMatGen, the first instance of a machine learning method which generates crystal structures that match a given desired electronic density of states. DOSMatGen is an E(3)-equivariant joint diffusion framework, and utilizes classifier-free guidance to accurately condition the generated materials on the density of states. Our experiments find this approach can successfully yield materials which are both stable and match closely with the desired density of states. Furthermore, this method is highly flexible and allows for finely controlled generation which can target specific templates or even individual sites within a material. This method enables a more physics-driven approach to designing new materials for applications including catalysts, photovoltaics, and superconductors.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06248v1" target="_blank">Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network   motifs</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Thibeault, Benjamin Claveau, Antoine Allard, Patrick Desrosiers</p>
            <p>The partial integrability of the Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06246v1" target="_blank">Appearance of Multiple Spectral Gaps in Voltage-Biased Josephson   Junctions Without Floquet Hybridization</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Zhang, Tatiana de Picoli, Tyler Lindemann, Jukka I. Väyrynen, Michael J. Manfra</p>
            <p>A time-periodic drive enables the engineering of non-equilibrium quantum systems by hybridizing Floquet sidebands. We investigated DC voltage-biased planar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in which the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a time-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is performed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the evolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe multiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise from a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the superconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our numerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width to coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization. This work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing voltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and provides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet effects.</p>
