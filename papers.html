            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23664v2" target="_blank">Measurements $\mathit{with}$ probabilities in the final state proposal</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Almheiri</p>
            <p>Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16523v2" target="_blank">Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas J. Elliott</p>
            <p>Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00761v2" target="_blank">What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Loparco, Joao Penedones, Yannis Ulrich</p>
            <p>The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</p>

            <p>To resolve the effective neutrino mass $m_\beta$ with an energy resolution of 50 meV, the PTOLEMY experiment has proposed a novel transverse electromagnetic filtering process. Perniciously reducing the kinetic energy of tritium $\beta$-decay electrons by counteracting motion from ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ and $\nabla{\rm B}$ drift, the PTOLEMY filter requires an input of emitted electron kinematic information to generate a tailored, suitable electric field for each endpoint candidate. The collaboration proposes to extract these quantities by using antennae to observe the relativistic frequency shift of emitted cyclotron radiation as an electron transits by ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ drift through a uniform magnetic field region preceding the filter. Electrons must be contained within this region long enough such that an adequate integrated radiated power signal is received to accurately estimate kinematics. This necessitates a controlled, slowed drift speed. However, a demonstration of slowing ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ drift for the purpose of increasing containment time has yet to be shown in a physical setup. Actualizing such a system is a crucial milestone in developing the detector, enabling future cyclotron radiation measurements, filter implementation, and source injection. This paper presents the experimental design to vary ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift speed of carbon-14 $\beta$-decay electrons using a custom electrode field cage situated between the pole faces of an electromagnet. Matching our results with high-fidelity simulation, we deduce a capacity to increase particle time of flight by a factor of 5 in the field cage's slow drift region. Limited only by the dimensions of our system, we assert drift speed can be arbitrarily slowed to meet the needs of PTOLEMY's future detector.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12494v2" target="_blank">SMURF: Scalable method for unsupervised reconstruction of flow in 4D   flow MRI</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atharva Hans, Abhishek Singh, Pavlos Vlachos, Ilias Bilionis</p>
            <p>We introduce SMURF, a scalable and unsupervised machine learning method for simultaneously segmenting vascular geometries and reconstructing velocity fields from 4D flow MRI data. SMURF models geometry and velocity fields using multilayer perceptron-based functions incorporating Fourier feature embeddings and random weight factorization to accelerate convergence. A measurement model connects these fields to the observed image magnitude and phase data. Maximum likelihood estimation and subsampling enable SMURF to process high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Evaluations on synthetic, in vitro, and in vivo datasets demonstrate SMURF's performance. On synthetic internal carotid artery aneurysm data derived from CFD, SMURF achieves a quarter-voxel segmentation accuracy across noise levels of up to 50%, outperforming the state-of-the-art segmentation method by up to double the accuracy. In an in vitro experiment on Poiseuille flow, SMURF reduces velocity reconstruction RMSE by approximately 34% compared to raw measurements. In in vivo internal carotid artery aneurysm data, SMURF attains nearly half-voxel segmentation accuracy relative to expert annotations and decreases median velocity divergence residuals by about 31%, with a 27% reduction in the interquartile range. These results indicate that SMURF is robust to noise, preserves flow structure, and identifies patient-specific morphological features. SMURF advances 4D flow MRI accuracy, potentially enhancing the diagnostic utility of 4D flow MRI in clinical applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13601v2" target="_blank">Dark Matter in an Evanescent Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Donini, Miguel G. Folgado, Juan Herrero-García, Giacomo Landini, Alejandro Muñoz-Ovalle, Nuria Rius</p>
            <p>Apart from its gravitational interactions, dark matter (DM) has remained so far elusive in laboratory searches. One possible explanation is that the relevant interactions to explain its relic abundance are mainly gravitational. In this work we consider an extradimensional Randall-Sundrum scenario with a TeV-PeV IR brane, where the Standard Model is located, and a GeV-TeV deep IR (DIR) one, where the DM lies. When the curvatures of the bulk to the left and right of the IR brane are very similar, the tension of the IR brane is significantly smaller than that of the other two branes, and therefore we term it \evanescent". In this setup, the relic abundance of DM arises from the freezeout mechanism, thanks to DM annihilations into radions and gravitons. Focusing on a scalar singlet DM candidate, we compute and apply current and future constraints from direct, indirect and collider-based searches. Our findings demonstrate the viability of this scenario and highlight its potential testability in upcoming experiments. We also discuss the possibility of inferring the number of branes if the radion and several Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances are detected at a future collider.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11361v2" target="_blank">Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Wang</p>
            <p>A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are easier to satisfy. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04979v3" target="_blank">Light quark energy loss in the flavor-dependent systems from holography</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Zhang, Lu Yin, Guo-Dong Zhou, Chao-Jie Fan, Xun Chen</p>
            <p>Using the holographic model of finite-endpoint-momentum shooting string approach, we study the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks for the flavor-dependent systems with $N_f = 0$, $N_f = 2$, and $N_f = 2+1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) framework. In particular, we investigate for the first time the impact of the flavor content of the strongly coupled QGP medium on the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks. It turns out that the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks is smallest for $N_f = 0$, and adding $u(d)$ quarks and $s$ quark in the system increases this energy loss. In addition, we found that the instantaneous energy loss in the strongly coupled plasma is minimal near the critical temperature, but it increases as the system moves away from the critical endpoint due to rising temperature or chemical potential.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17879v2" target="_blank">LLM4SG: Large Language Models for Scatterer Generation via Synesthesia   of Machines</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zengrui Han, Lu Bai, Ziwei Huang, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), the nonlinear mapping relationship between sensory and communication information serves as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy and generalization of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To explore the general mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset, named V2V-M3, is constructed for multiple scenarios in V2V communications with multiple frequency bands and multiple vehicular traffic densities (VTDs). Leveraging the strong representation and cross-modal inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a novel LLM-based method for Scatterer Generation (LLM4SG) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is developed. To address the inherent and significant differences across multi-modal data, synergistically optimized four-module architecture, i.e., preprocessor, embedding, backbone, and output modules, are designed by considering the sensing/channel characteristics and electromagnetic propagation mechanism. On the basis of cross-modal representation alignment and positional encoding, the network of LLM4SG is fine-tuned to capture the general mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4SG achieves superior performance in full-sample and generalization testing, significantly outperforming small models across different frequency bands, scenarios, and VTDs.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09918v2" target="_blank">Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials:   Instabilities and other Questions</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Lenzi, Arnau Montava Agudo, Carlos F. Sopuerta</p>
            <p>Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</p>
