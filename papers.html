            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14506v1" target="_blank">Scalable and fault-tolerant preparation of encoded k-uniform states</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Majidy, Dominik Hangleiter, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>$k$-uniform states are valuable resources in quantum information, enabling tasks such as teleportation, error correction, and accelerated quantum simulations. The practical realization of $k$-uniform states, at scale, faces major obstacles: verifying $k$-uniformity is as difficult as measuring code distances, and devising fault-tolerant preparation protocols further adds to the complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable, fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded $k$-uniform states, and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine $k$-uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded $k$-uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of $k$-uniform states.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14502v1" target="_blank">Precise Quantum Chemistry calculations with few Slater Determinants</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clemens Giuliani, Jannes Nys, Rocco Martinazzo, Giuseppe Carleo, Riccardo Rossi</p>
            <p>Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach exploits the quadratic dependence of the energy on selected parameters, permitting their exact optimization, and employs an efficient tensor contraction algorithm to compute the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost scaling as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis. We conclude by discussing limitations and extensions of the technique, and the potential impact on other many-body methods.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14497v1" target="_blank">Strong local uniqueness for the vacant set of random interlacements</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Goswami, Pierre-Fran√ßois Rodriguez, Yuriy Shulzhenko</p>
            <p>We consider the the vacant set $\mathcal{V}^u$ of random interlacements on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. For varying intensity $u > 0$, the connectivity properties of $\mathcal V^u$ undergo a percolation phase transition across a non-degenerate critical parameter $u_* \in (0,\infty)$. As a consequence of the series of recent works arXiv:2308.07303, arXiv:2308.07919 and arXiv:2308.07920, one knows that in the super-critical regime, i.e. when $u < u_\ast$, there is a cluster of positive density inside any ball of radius $R$ with probability stretched exponentially close to $1$ in $R$. Furthermore, with similar probability, any two large clusters are connected to each other locally in any configuration with strictly smaller intensity. This last property falls short of the classical local uniqueness, which requires a connection in the same configuration, i.e. in absence of any sprinkling. In this article we resolve this question by proving a stronger property, namely that local uniqueness holds simultaneously for all configurations $\mathcal{V}^{v}$ with $v \le u$. Apart from the severe degeneracies in the conditional law of $\mathcal{V}^u$ including the lack of any finite-energy property, our methods also face up to the well-known problem of decoupling non-monotone events, by exhibiting a certain regularity in terms of so-called excursion packets, which has implications beyond the scope of this paper. Our approach suggests a robust way to tackle similar problems for various other (correlated) models. In itself, the strong local uniqueness we prove yields several important results characterizing the super-critical phase of $\mathcal{V}^u$, among which are the large-scale geometry of the infinite cluster and sharp upper bounds on truncated connectivity functions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14496v1" target="_blank">Relativistic Fractons and their Dust</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiuyue Liang, Tom Melia</p>
            <p>We define a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for the restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles. The theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. We argue that the existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background and show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14491v1" target="_blank">Partial Quantum Shadow Tomography for Structured Operators and its   Experimental Demonstration using NMR</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniket Sengupta, Arijit Chatterjee, Sreejith G. J., T. S. Mahesh</p>
            <p>Quantum shadow tomography based on the classical shadow representation provides an efficient way to estimate properties of an unknown quantum state without performing a full quantum state tomography. In scenarios where estimating the expectation values for only certain classes of observables is required, obtaining information about the entire density matrix is unnecessary. We propose a partial quantum shadow tomography protocol, which allows estimation of a subset of density matrix elements contributing to the expectation values of certain classes of structured observables. This method utilizes tomographically incomplete subsets of single qubit Pauli basis measurements to perform partial shadow tomography, making it experimentally more efficient. We demonstrate the advantage over unitary $k$-designs such as Clifford, full Pauli basis, and methods utilizing mutually unbiased bases by numerically analyzing the protocol for structured density matrices and observables. We experimentally demonstrate the partial shadow estimation scheme for a wide class of two-qubit states (pure, entangled, and mixed) in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform, which relies on ensemble-based measurements. The full density matrix experimentally reconstructed by combining different partial estimators produces fidelities exceeding 97%.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14492v1" target="_blank">Cosmos-Transfer1: Conditional World Generation with Adaptive Multimodal   Control</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong>  NVIDIA,  :, Hassan Abu Alhaija, Jose Alvarez, Maciej Bala, Tiffany Cai, Tianshi Cao, Liz Cha, Joshua Chen, Mike Chen, Francesco Ferroni, Sanja Fidler, Dieter Fox, Yunhao Ge, Jinwei Gu, Ali Hassani, Michael Isaev, Pooya Jannaty, Shiyi Lan, Tobias Lasser, Huan Ling, Ming-Yu Liu, Xian Liu, Yifan Lu, Alice Luo, Qianli Ma, Hanzi Mao, Fabio Ramos, Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Shitao Tang, Ting-Chun Wang, Jay Wu, Jiashu Xu, Stella Xu, Kevin Xie, Yuchong Ye, Xiaodong Yang, Xiaohui Zeng, Yu Zeng</p>
            <p>We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI, including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack. To help accelerate research development in the field, we open-source our models and code at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14490v1" target="_blank">TEPID-ADAPT: Adaptive variational method for simultaneous preparation of   low-temperature Gibbs and low-lying eigenstates</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Sambasivam, Kyle Sherbert, Karunya Shirali, Nicholas J. Mayhall, Edwin Barnes, Sophia E. Economou</p>
            <p>Preparing Gibbs states, which describe systems in equilibrium at finite temperature, is of great importance, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a new method -- TEPID-ADAPT -- that prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a given Hamiltonian at low temperatures using a variational method that is partially adaptive and uses a minimal number of ancillary qubits. We achieve this using a truncated, parametrized eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Beyond preparing Gibbs states, this approach also straightforwardly gives us access to the truncated low-energy eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian, making it also a method that prepares excited states simultaneously. As a result of this, we are also able to prepare thermal states at any lower temperature of the same Hamiltonian without further optimization.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20328v2" target="_blank">Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with   Unruh-DeWitt detectors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Georg Passegger, Rainer Verch</p>
            <p>We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10808v2" target="_blank">Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with   Multiwavelets and DMRG</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00421v2" target="_blank">A Comprehensive Framework for Electroweak Phase Transitions: Thermal   History and Dynamics from Bubble Nucleation to Percolation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haibin Chen, Yun Jiang</p>
            <p>The electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is crucial for cosmology and particle physics, with a profound impact on electroweak baryogenesis, symmetry breaking, and gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, many studies overlook key aspects of EWPT dynamics, leading to misidentified patterns and overestimated GW signals. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive framework for analyzing EWPTs, focusing on the vacuum's thermal history and dynamics from bubble nucleation to percolation. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real scalar singlet model, we demonstrate the occurrence of spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking in the high-temperature vacuum, leading to diverse EWPT processes, including multi-step transitions and inverse symmetry breaking. We identify four distinct EWPT patterns, each characterized by unique symmetry-breaking mechanisms and associated with bubbles exhibiting distinct field configurations, which can be analyzed using a formalism based on energy density distributions developed here. A key finding is that bubble nucleation fails in extremely strong phase transitions (PTs) with low nucleation rates, or in ultra-fast PTs involving inverse $s$-bubbles that collapse instantly upon formation, both of which lead to false vacuum trapping and the absence of observable GW signals. In first-order PTs where nucleation succeeds, stronger transitions occur later in the universe's evolution, while weaker transitions proceed more rapidly. Multi-step transitions involving (inverse) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking give rise to complex transition sequences and exotic bubble dynamics, such as sequential nucleation or the coexistence of bubbles from different vacua -- phenomena with significant implications for GW spectra, dark matter, and baryogenesis. This work advances our understanding of EWPT dynamics and lays the groundwork for future studies of EWPTs in BSM physics.</p>
