            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07486v1" target="_blank">Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Kalash, Aditya Sudharsanam, M. H. M. Passos, Valentina Parigi, Maria Chekhova</p>
            <p>Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07481v1" target="_blank">Learning Physics-Based Full-Body Human Reaching and Grasping from Brief   Walking References</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitang Li, Mingxian Lin, Zhuo Lin, Yipeng Deng, Yue Cao, Li Yi</p>
            <p>Existing motion generation methods based on mocap data are often limited by data quality and coverage. In this work, we propose a framework that generates diverse, physically feasible full-body human reaching and grasping motions using only brief walking mocap data. Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07479v1" target="_blank">QBIT: Quality-Aware Cloud-Based Benchmarking for Robotic Insertion Tasks</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Constantin Schempp, Yongzhou Zhang, Christian Friedrich, Bjorn Hein</p>
            <p>Insertion tasks are fundamental yet challenging for robots, particularly in autonomous operations, due to their continuous interaction with the environment. AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07474v1" target="_blank">Revealing Rotational Symmetry Breaking Charge-density Wave Order in   Kagome Superconductor (Rb, K)V$_3$Sb$_5$ by Ultrafast Pump-probe Experiments</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinwen Deng, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Binghai Yan, Liang Wu</p>
            <p>The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07469v1" target="_blank">Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Y. Park, P. Y. Wui</p>
            <p>We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System, we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07468v1" target="_blank">Magic dynamics in many-body localized systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Emanuele Tirrito</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, characterizes the beyond-Clifford operations needed to prepare a quantum state and constitutes an essential resource, alongside entanglement, for achieving quantum advantage. This work investigates how nonstabilizerness spreads under the dynamics of disordered quantum many-body systems. Using the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological model of many-body localization (MBL), we present an analytical description of the nonstabilizerness growth in MBL systems. We demonstrate that our analytical formulas describe the nonstabilizerness growth in strongly disordered quantum spin chains. Our findings establish a new facet of MBL phenomenology and identify the vital role of the disorder in slowing down the growth of the complexity of quantum states, important for our understanding of quantum advantage.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07467v1" target="_blank">Construction of blowup solutions for Liouville systems</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zetao Cheng, Haoyu Li, Lei Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation}   \left\{   \begin{array}{lr}   -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber   u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber,   \end{array}   \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j>0$, $\rho_j>0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07466v1" target="_blank">European supercell thunderstorms -- an underestimated current threat and   an increasing future hazard</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monika Feldmann, Michael Blanc, Killian P. Brennan, Iris Thurnherr, Patricio Velasquez, Olivia Martius, Christoph Schär</p>
            <p>Supercell thunderstorms are the most hazardous thunderstorm category and particularly impactful to society. Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, a first-of-its-kind characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe is derived for the current and a warmer climate. Despite previous notions of supercells being uncommon in Europe, the model shows ~700 supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are co-located with complex topography e.g. the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps with minima over the oceans and flat areas. Contrasting a current-climate simulation with a pseudo-global-warming +3$^\circ$C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11 %. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07464v1" target="_blank">Learning to Localize Leakage of Cryptographic Sensitive Variables</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimmy Gammell, Anand Raghunathan, Abolfazl Hashemi, Kaushik Roy</p>
            <p>While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption. In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible). Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.</p>
