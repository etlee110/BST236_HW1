            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13446v1" target="_blank">MoManipVLA: Transferring Vision-language-action Models for General   Mobile Manipulation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Wu, Yuheng Zhou, Xiuwei Xu, Ziwei Wang, Haibin Yan</p>
            <p>Mobile manipulation is the fundamental challenge for robotics to assist humans with diverse tasks and environments in everyday life. However, conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across different tasks and environments because of the lack of large-scale training. In contrast, recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization capabilities, but these foundation models are developed for fixed-base manipulation tasks. Therefore, we propose an efficient policy adaptation framework named MoManipVLA to transfer pre-trained VLA models of fix-base manipulation to mobile manipulation, so that high generalization ability across tasks and environments can be achieved in mobile manipulation policy. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained VLA models to generate waypoints of the end-effector with high generalization ability. We design motion planning objectives for the mobile base and the robot arm, which aim at maximizing the physical feasibility of the trajectory. Finally, we present an efficient bi-level objective optimization framework for trajectory generation, where the upper-level optimization predicts waypoints for base movement to enhance the manipulator policy space, and the lower-level optimization selects the optimal end-effector trajectory to complete the manipulation task. In this way, MoManipVLA can adjust the position of the robot base in a zero-shot manner, thus making the waypoints predicted from the fixed-base VLA models feasible. Extensive experimental results on OVMM and the real world demonstrate that MoManipVLA achieves a 4.2% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation, and only requires 50 training cost for real world deployment due to the strong generalization ability in the pre-trained VLA models.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13437v1" target="_blank">Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Khudoteplov, Alexei Morozov, Alexey Sleptsov</p>
            <p>Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.   We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13425v1" target="_blank">Movement Sequencing: A Novel Approach to Quantifying the Building Blocks   of Human Gait</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra Hammerberg, Samuel Grunblatt, Patricia Kramer</p>
            <p>By 2050, a quarter of the US population will be over the age of 65 with greater than a 40% risk of developing life-altering neuromusculoskeletal pathologies. The potential of wearables, such as Apple AirPods and hearing aids, to provide personalized preventative and predictive health monitoring outside of the clinic is nascent, but large quantities of open-ended data that capture movement in the physical world now exist. Algorithms that leverage existing wearable technology to detect subtle changes to walking mechanics, an early indicator of neuromusculoskeletal pathology, have successfully been developed to determine population-level statistics, but individual-level variability is more difficult to parse from population-level data. Like genetic sequencing, the individual's gait pattern can be discerned by decomposing the movement signal into its fundamental features from which we can detect "mutations" or changes to the pattern that are early indicators of pathology - movement-based biomarkers. We have developed a novel approach to quantify "normal baseline movement" at an individual level, combining methods from gait laboratories with methods used to characterize stellar oscillations. We tested our approach by asking participants to complete an outdoor circuit while wearing a pair of AirPods, using orthopaedic braces to simulate pathology. We found that the novel features we propose are sensitive enough to distinguish between normal walking and brace walking at the population level and at the individual level in all sensor directions (both p $<$ 0.05). We also perform principal component analysis on our population-level and individual-level models, and find significant differences between individuals as well as between the overall population model and most individuals. We also demonstrate the potential of these gait features in deep learning applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13424v1" target="_blank">Infinite Mobility: Scalable High-Fidelity Synthesis of Articulated   Objects via Procedural Generation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Lian, Zichao Yu, Ruiming Liang, Yitong Wang, Li Ray Luo, Kaixu Chen, Yuanzhen Zhou, Qihong Tang, Xudong Xu, Zhaoyang Lyu, Bo Dai, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
            <p>Large-scale articulated objects with high quality are desperately needed for multiple tasks related to embodied AI. Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04207v2" target="_blank">Background ambiguity and the Gödel double copy</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brian Kent, Tucker Manton, Sanjit Shashi</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the assumptions regarding spacetime backgrounds underlying the classical double copy. We argue (contrary to the norm) that single-copy fields naturally constructed on the original curved background metric are only interpretable on a flat metric when such a well-defined limit exists, for which Kerr--Schild coordinates offer a natural choice. As an explicit example where such a distinction matters, we initiate an exploration of single-copies for the G\"odel universe. This metric lacks a (geodesic) Kerr--Schild representation yet is Petrov type-D, meaning the technology of the ``Weyl double copy" may be utilized. The Weyl derived single copy has many desirable features, including matching the defining properties of the spacetime, and being sourced by the mixed Ricci tensor just as Kerr--Schild single copies are. To compare, we propose a sourced flat-space single-copy interpretation for the G\"odel metric by leveraging its symmetries, and find that this proposal lacks the defining properties of the spacetime, and is not consistent with the flat limit of our curved-space single copy. Notably, this inconsistency does not occur in Kerr--Schild metrics. Our curved-space single copy also lead to the same electromagnetic analogue of the G\"odel universe found separately through tidal force analogies, opening a new avenue of exploration between the double copy and gravitoelectromagnetism programs.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13422v1" target="_blank">Engineering Moiré Kagome Superlattices in Twisted Transition Metal   Dichalcogenides</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Fedorko, Chao-Xing Liu, Zhen Bi</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to achieve breathing kagome moir\'e superlattices using three twisted layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moir\'e potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moir\'e band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13417v1" target="_blank">Wannier-Function-Based Approach to Coupled Exciton-Phonon-Photon   Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Steinhoff, Frank Jahnke, Matthias Florian</p>
            <p>Marrying the predictive power of ab initio calculations with many-body effects remains a challenging task in two-dimensional (2d) materials, where efficient carrier-carrier interaction challenges established approximation schemes. In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11973v2" target="_blank">Boosted Dark Matter Driven by Cosmic Rays and Diffuse Supernova   Neutrinos</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dilip Kumar Ghosh, Tushar Gupta, Matti Heikinheimo, Katri Huitu, Sk Jeesun</p>
            <p>Direct detection of light dark matter can be significantly enhanced by up-scattering of dark matter with energetic particles in the cosmic ambient. This boosted dark matter flux can reach kinetic energies up to tens of MeV, while the typical kinetic energies of GeV mass dark matter particles in the Milky Way halo are of the order of keV. Dark matter boosted by energetic diffuse supernova background neutrinos can be detected only through nuclear or electron scattering in ground-based detectors requiring a non-zero interaction of dark matter with nucleon or electron, in addition to its interaction with neutrino. However, in the presence of dark matter-nucleon (electron) interaction, the scattering of dark matter with cosmic rays is unavoidable. Thus, we consider boosted dark matter resulting from diffuse supernova neutrinos as well as cosmic protons (electrons) considering both energy-dependent and energy-independent scattering cross-sections between dark matter and standard model particles. We explore this scenario in dark matter detectors such as XENONnT and neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13411v1" target="_blank">Mixed spin-boson coupling for qubit readout with suppressed residual   shot-noise dephasing</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinlun Hu, Antonio L. R. Manesco, André Melo, Taryn V. Stefanski, Christian Kraglund Andersen, Valla Fatemi</p>
            <p>Direct dipole coupling between a two-level system and a bosonic mode describes the interactions present in a wide range of physical platforms. In this work, we study a coupling that is mixed between two pairs of quadratures of a bosonic mode and a spin. In this setting, we can suppress the dispersive shift while retaining a nonzero Kerr shift, which remarkably results in a cubic relationship between shot noise dephasing and thermal photons in the oscillator. We demonstrate this configuration with a simple toy model, quantify the expected improvements to photon shot-noise dephasing of the spin, and describe an approach to fast qubit readout via the Kerr shift. Further, we show how such a regime is achievable in superconducting circuits because magnetic and electric couplings can be of comparable strength, using two examples: the Cooper pair transistor and the fluxonium molecule.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13408v1" target="_blank">Spectral properties and spin alignment of $φ$ meson in QCD Matter</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhong-Yuan Sun, You-Yu Li, Shuai Y. F. Liu</p>
            <p>As the spin alignment of a vector meson is predicted to be correlated with its spectral properties, we study the spectral properties of the $\phi$ meson using two microscopic Lagrangians based either on chiral effective field theory or the quark-meson model. We calculate the self-energies and spectral functions of the $\phi$ meson for these two Lagrangians at the one-loop level within the Matsubara formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory, employing various parameters to represent different physical scenarios. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained, connecting the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson to hydrodynamic gradients. Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior in their $p_T$ and centrality dependence, similar to those observed in experiments.</p>
