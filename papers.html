            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18949v1" target="_blank">Almost device-independent calibration beyond Born's rule: Bell tests for   cross-talk detection</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gelo Noel M. Tabia, Alex Yueh-Ting Shih, Jin-Yuan Zheng, Yeong-Cherng Liang</p>
            <p>In quantum information, device-independent protocols offer a new approach to information processing tasks, making minimal assumptions about the devices used. Typically, since these protocols draw conclusions directly from the data collected in a meaningful Bell test, the no-signaling conditions, and often even Born's rule for local measurements, are taken as premises of the protocol. Here, we demonstrate how to test such premises in an (almost) device-independent setting, i.e., directly from the raw data and with minimal assumptions. In particular, for IBM's quantum computing cloud services, we implement the prediction-based ratio protocol to characterize how well the qubits can be accessed locally and independently. More precisely, by performing a variety of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type experiments on these systems and carrying out rigorous hypothesis tests on the collected data, we provide compelling evidence showing that some of these qubits suffer from cross-talks, i.e., their measurement statistics are affected by the choice of measurement bases on another qubit. Unlike standard randomized benchmarking, our approach does not rely on assumptions such as gate-independent Markovian noise. Moreover, despite the relatively small number of experimental trials, the direction of "signaling" may also be identified in some cases. Our approach thus serves as a complementary tool for benchmarking the local addressability of quantum computing devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18946v1" target="_blank">In-plane magnetic field-induced orbital FFLO superconductivity in   twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18945v2" target="_blank">Aether: Geometric-Aware Unified World Modeling</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong>  Aether Team, Haoyi Zhu, Yifan Wang, Jianjun Zhou, Wenzheng Chang, Yang Zhou, Zizun Li, Junyi Chen, Chunhua Shen, Jiangmiao Pang, Tong He</p>
            <p>The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18939v1" target="_blank">Simulation of Fermionic circuits using Majorana Propagation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Miller, Zoë Holmes, Özlem Salehi, Rahul Chakraborty, Anton Nykänen, Zoltán Zimborás, Adam Glos, Guillermo García-Pérez</p>
            <p>We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18937v1" target="_blank">Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and   the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohua Li, Joel Meyers, Paul R. Shapiro</p>
            <p>We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18936v1" target="_blank">Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via   Krylov spread complexity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Medina-Guerra, I. V. Gornyi, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18935v1" target="_blank">A particle physicist lacing their shoes</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Alonso</p>
            <p>This letter presents the solution to a counting problem, to the best of our knowledge not known in full generality, which can be mapped to both (i) ways to lace a $N$-holes-per-side shoe with $\ell$ shoestrings and (ii) a sum over the indexes of $2N$-tensors made of symmetric 2-tensors. The coefficients that answer this question are then connected to spin $J=N$ boson exchange amplitudes and perturbative unitarity constraints, deriving relations with Legendre polynomials and sum rules.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18930v1" target="_blank">Quantum Memory Enhanced Multipoint Correlation Spectroscopy for   Statistically Polarized NMR</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Spohn, Nicolas Staudenmaier, Philipp J. Vetter, Timo Joas, Thomas Unden, Ilai Schwartz, Philipp Neumann, Genko Genov, Fedor Jelezko</p>
            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with solid-state spin sensors is a promising pathway for the detection of nuclear spins at the micro- and nanoscale. Although many nanoscale experiments rely on a single sensor spin for the detection of the signal, leveraging spin ensembles can enhance sensitivity, particularly in cases in which the signal merely originates from statistically polarized nuclear spins. In this work, we introduce multipoint correlation spectroscopy, that combines the advantages of two well-established methods -- correlation spectroscopy and quantum heterodyne detection -- to enable temporally efficient measurements of statistically polarized samples at the nanoscale with spin ensembles. We present a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate an experimental proof of concept with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We achieve single hertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency, highlighting the potential applications of the technique for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18927v1" target="_blank">Interaction of a Poincaré beam with optically polarized atoms in the   presence of constant magnetic field</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Ramakrishna, S. Fritzsche</p>
            <p>Recent studies have highlighted the frequent applications of structured light modes in optically pumped atomic magnetometers. In this work, we theoretically explore how a Poincar\'e beam probes an optically polarized atomic medium. Specifically, we consider atoms polarized by a plane wave with linear polarization, immersed in a constant external magnetic field. We analyze how the polarization of the pump and probe light fields, along with the external magnetic field, impact the absorption profile. To this end, we employ a density matrix approach based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation. Our results reveal that the absorption profile exhibits an asymmetric pattern that depends on the magnetic field strength and the mutual orientation of the pump and probe light propagation directions relative to the quantization axis. For illustration, we assume the incoming radiation drives an electric dipole transition, $5s \, ^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $\rightarrow$ $5p \, ^2P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$), in rubidium atoms subjected to a magnetic field. These findings may aid in designing future experiments on optically pumped atomic magnetometers utilizing structured light modes.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18925v1" target="_blank">Strong coupling of dipole trapped atomic ensembles to a ring cavity</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Olney, V. Naniyil, V. Boyer, J. Goldwin, A. B. Deb</p>
            <p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics systems using atoms in resonant optical cavities are central elements of many applications such as quantum networks and quantum-enhanced sensing. We present a novel experimental setup that achieves strong spatial mode-matching between a resonant mode of a triangular ring resonator and an ensemble of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical dipole trap. We realise a large-volume, 0.5\,mK deep cavity-assisted optical dipole trap from a laser beam of modest power locked to a resonant mode of the cavity through the intracavity power build-up effect, allowing efficient loading of the trap from a magneto-optical trap. We observe dipole trapping of atoms through the vacuum Rabi splitting of the transmission spectrum of a weak probe beam near resonant with the cavity, which demonstrates collective strong coupling of the ensemble of atoms to the cavity after the magneto-optical trap is turned off. The work paves the way for a highly suitable platform for cavity-assisted quantum sensing of magnetic and electric fields.</p>
